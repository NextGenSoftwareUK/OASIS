Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Fullstack Backend Engineer position. With extensive experience building blockchain forensics tools, AI-powered communication integrations, and rapid MVP prototyping, I am confident I can immediately contribute to your crypto asset recovery platform and AI-integrated communication tools.

BLOCKCHAIN & CRYPTO FORENSICS EXPERIENCE

I have architected and deployed OASIS, a universal Web4/Web5 platform that integrates 50+ blockchain networks including Ethereum, Solana, Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, Avalanche, and BNB Chain. This work directly aligns with your crypto asset recovery platform requirements:

• Built comprehensive blockchain data aggregation systems that query and visualize wallet addresses, token balances, and transaction histories across multiple chains
• Integrated blockchain data APIs including Etherscan, Solana Explorer, and custom RPC endpoints for real-time on-chain data analysis
• Developed NFT tracking and transfer visualization systems with interactive blockchain forensics capabilities (2-3 hop transaction tracing with metadata tooltips)
• Implemented cross-chain wallet management with support for EVM and non-EVM networks, including address validation and balance tracking across 15+ blockchain providers

The OASIS platform processes blockchain data at scale, with intelligent routing between providers based on network conditions and gas fees - precisely the type of system architecture needed for efficient crypto asset recovery.

MESSAGING API INTEGRATIONS & AI-POWERED TOOLS

I have successfully built production messaging integrations that directly translate to your Slack and WhatsApp requirements:

Telegram Integration (Production):
• Developed complete Telegram bot with MTProto client integration, handling 500+ concurrent users
• Built message queue system with intelligent rate limiting and automated retry logic
• Implemented webhook architecture for real-time message processing
• Created campaign management system with contact segmentation and scheduled messaging
• Integrated MongoDB for user data, message history, and analytics tracking

This experience provides immediate applicability to both the Slack Company Coach and WhatsApp landlord-tenant platform. I understand API rate limits, message delivery guarantees, and building robust chatbot workflows.

AI & LLM INTEGRATION CAPABILITIES

While the OASIS platform focuses on blockchain aggregation, I have designed systems specifically for LLM integration:

• Built template-based message generation systems with variable substitution - directly applicable to prompt engineering
• Implemented context-aware user interaction flows with state management
• Designed systems for aggregating multi-source data (blockchain, databases, APIs) into unified contexts for AI processing
• Created analytics dashboards that would translate well to LLM conversation insights and user behavior tracking

I am proficient with AI development tools (Cursor AI, GitHub Copilot) and understand vector-based memory systems, context windows, and prompt optimization strategies critical for production LLM applications.

TECHNICAL STACK ALIGNMENT

Backend Expertise:
• Node.js + Express: Built multiple REST APIs with comprehensive endpoint coverage
• TypeScript: Full-stack type safety across all projects
• Firebase/Supabase equivalents: Extensive experience with MongoDB Atlas, PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, and Redis for rapid prototyping
• Database mastery: Implemented systems across MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Neo4j (graph DB), Redis, and SQLite

Frontend Development:
• React expertise: Built multiple production UIs including NFT minting wizard, wallet management dashboard, and real-time analytics interfaces
• Next.js 15: Current NFT minting frontend using latest App Router architecture
• TypeScript: Comprehensive type safety with complex state management
• Tailwind CSS: Modern styling across all frontend projects

API Integration & Automation:
• Messaging APIs: Production Telegram bot with full API integration (easily transferable to Slack/Twilio)
• Webhook architecture: Built real-time event processing systems
• Third-party integrations: Extensive experience with blockchain APIs, IPFS (Pinata), cloud services (AWS, Azure)
• Authentication: JWT implementation with role-based access control across multi-tenant systems

RAPID PROTOTYPING & MVP DEVELOPMENT

I excel in fast-iteration environments and have delivered multiple MVPs:

• NFT Minting Platform: Next.js wizard interface with Solana/Ethereum integration - 4 weeks from concept to production
• Telegram Accountability Bot: Complete bot with group management, achievements, and token rewards - 3 weeks to MVP
• Cross-Chain Wallet UI: React dashboard with multi-provider support - 2 weeks to functional prototype
• Blockchain Provider System: Hot-swappable plugin architecture supporting 50+ chains - iterative development over 8 weeks

Each project demonstrates my ability to rapidly prototype core functionality, then iterate based on user feedback - exactly what's needed in an early-stage environment.

DASHBOARD & ANALYTICS EXPERIENCE

I have built comprehensive analytics and visualization systems:

• Real-time campaign performance dashboards with delivery metrics, error tracking, and user behavior analysis
• Blockchain transaction visualizers with multi-hop traversal and interactive tooltips
• Account health monitoring with predictive analytics and automated alerting
• Multi-tenant analytics with user segmentation and A/B testing infrastructure
• Export functionality for reports (CSV, PDF) and data portability

These systems use similar patterns to what would be needed for Slack team insights and landlord-tenant communication analytics.

DEPLOYMENT & INFRASTRUCTURE

Production deployment experience:
• AWS (ECS Fargate, ECR, CloudFront, RDS, DynamoDB, ElastiCache)
• Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
• GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines
• MongoDB Atlas and PostgreSQL managed databases
• Real-time monitoring with CloudWatch and Application Insights

RELEVANT PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

1. Telegram NFT Minting Bot (Most Relevant):
   • Users send photos via Telegram → uploads to IPFS → mints on-chain NFT → delivers to Solana wallet
   • Implemented rate limiting, queue management, retry logic, and delivery confirmation
   • JWT authentication, MongoDB storage, real-time analytics
   • This demonstrates the exact pattern needed for your messaging apps

2. Universal Blockchain API (OASIS):
   • Aggregates data from 50+ blockchains and databases
   • Intelligent auto-failover and load balancing
   • GraphQL/REST endpoints with comprehensive API documentation
   • Multi-tenant architecture with complete data isolation
   • This provides the foundation for blockchain forensics visualization

3. NFT Marketplace Frontend:
   • Next.js 15 + React + TypeScript
   • Multi-step wizard with state management
   • Real-time provider status and error handling
   • Pinata IPFS integration for media
   • This demonstrates rapid frontend prototyping capability

WHY I'M THE RIGHT FIT

I bring a unique combination of:
• Proven blockchain/crypto expertise with production systems handling real user assets
• Messaging API integration experience directly applicable to Slack and WhatsApp
• Rapid prototyping ability with track record of MVPs delivered in 2-4 week sprints
• Full-stack capabilities from database design to frontend polish
• Comfort with AI tools and understanding of LLM integration patterns
• Production deployment experience with monitoring and scaling

Most importantly, I thrive in fast-paced, early-stage environments where "vibe coding" and rapid iteration are essential. My OASIS platform demonstrates my ability to architect complex systems while moving quickly and adapting to changing requirements.

IMMEDIATE VALUE

I can hit the ground running on:
• Day 1-7: Architecture design for crypto recovery platform, WhatsApp bot POC, Slack integration prototype
• Week 2-3: Core blockchain forensics visualization, LLM chatbot integration, dashboard v1
• Week 4+: Production-ready MVPs with analytics, user testing, and iteration

I am excited about the opportunity to build cutting-edge tools that make blockchain accessible and create AI-first communication platforms. The combination of crypto recovery (leveraging my blockchain expertise) and messaging automation (leveraging my Telegram integration experience) is exactly where my skills align.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience building production blockchain systems and messaging integrations can contribute to your innovative products. I am available for an interview at your convenience.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
