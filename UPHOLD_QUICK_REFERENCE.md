# Uphold Interview: Quick Reference Card
## Key Points for Your Interview Today

## 🎯 Your 30-Second Pitch

> "I've built production-ready infrastructure for tokenizing real-world assets with automatic revenue distribution - think fractional real estate where monthly rent flows to token holders in 30 seconds. I've proven this works with 432 NFTs earning passive income. With Uphold's 10M users and 'Anything-to-Anything' vision, we could launch RWA products in 6 months, capturing the $16T tokenization opportunity. I'm excited about sports/entertainment RWAs, debit card rewards, and UK Web3 policy leadership."

## 🎤 Key Talking Points

### Speed to Market
"I've built the infrastructure - x402, OASIS, universal tokens. Uphold could launch first RWA products in 90 days, not 2 years."

### Production-Ready
"This isn't theoretical - 432 NFTs earning real revenue today. The system is production-ready, documented, and proven."

### Strategic Alignment
"Uphold's 'Anything-to-Anything' brand is perfect for RWAs. You have 10M users who trust you. My infrastructure fills the gap."

### UK Opportunity
"UK is at an inflection point - FCA is open, government is crypto-friendly, but no one is leading consumer RWA policy. Uphold could be first."
