## Introduction

**NOTE: This documentation & code is a WIP and is still currently being written so please make sure you check back often...**

**We would love to hear from you regarding feedback on any of the vision, docs, code or would like to submit ideas. Even better, if you would like to get actively involved by coding, spreading the word, finding funding or any other role then please get in touch right NOW! :) Contact us on our Telegram group https://t.me/ourworldthegamechat Thank you.**

## Overview

The WEB4 OASIS API enables you to integrate your project with everything else (WEB2 & WEB3) such as all blockchains, holochain & much more. It also provides SSO, load balancing, auto failover, auto replication, zero downtime, zero lag, infinite players and much more!

Various OASIS API functions and services can be accessed with this API such as Authentication, Karma, Avatars, Data, SEEDS, Wallets/Keys & more...

http://api.oasisplatform.world

This allows you to bridge between all of WEB2 & WEB3 Holochain, IPFS, MongoDB, SQLLite, Neo4j, Solana, Ethereum, EOS & ThreeFold with many more coming soon such as COSMOS, Polkadot, Polygon, SOLID, ActivityPub, Near, Nexus, HIVE, CEPTR Pluggable Protocol, Fediverse, XMPP & many more! :) The majority of these are aimed at building a truly decentralised distributed internet (Web 3.0) and this is also the aim of the OASIS API. If you wish to get involved and help build out any of these providers or any other you would like to see integrated please get in touch here: https://t.me/ourworldthegamechat. 

WEB 4 OASIS API is a fully distributed decentralised fault tolerant load balanced integrated API that runs across the full Internet acting as an abstraction layer over everything and serves as a network of networks. It is unity consciousnes expressed within the technical sphere. [The OASIS API is a global universal API that aims to connect anything to everything](https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK#the-universal-api-to-connect-everything-to-everything--no-more-silos-walled-gardens-) to eliminate walled gardens/silos.

The core OASIS (Open Advanced Sensory Immersion System) API that powers Our World/One World and manages the central profile/avatar/karma system that other satellite apps/games/sites/services plug into it and share. This allows karma to be earnt in the satellite apps/games by doing good deeds or progressing self help apps for example.


### Best Of All Worlds

Just like a team of people, different tech has various strengths and weaknesses, by integrating them together so they work as one unified co-ordinated team, you eliminate all weaknesses and then have the best of all worlds, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. It harnesses the best of each provider so the OASIS uses the strengths of each provider to the maximum and removes all weaknesses, it automatically uses the most appropriate provider or providers for any given use case.

### Maximum Interopability/Aggregation

One of the core design goals of the OASIS is maximum interoperability (to remove all silos and walled gardens) to the point everything merges into one (the singularity) and also to be super powerful but super easy and intuitive to use.

The WEB4 OASIS API connects & Integrates everything (all of WEB 2 & WEB 3) including all blockchains, holochain, IPFS, databases, cloud etc into one fully unified API that is an abstraction layer over everything.

The whole point of the OASIS API is to allow everything to be fully interoperable so data can be shared between any provider, the architecture opens the doors for many more use cases like importing and exporting your data between providers, aggregating all your data to remove all silos so better sense making and AI machine learning can be made to analyse and to make predictions, smart contract interoperability, etc


### HOT Swappable Plugin Architecture

The OASIS API features a HOT Swappable Plugin Architecture meaning any OASIS Provider can be deployed and used at runtime without having to re-compile or deploy a ONODE (OASIS Node). 


### Full Redundancy/Zero Downtime/Impossible To Shutdown!

It also allows full data redundancy and for it to be network independent so if one network goes down it can automatically switch to the next fastest node in your area regardless of what network it is on. So it will be impossible to shut the OASIS down, you need to shut the entire Internet down, goodluck with that! ;-)


### HTTP REST/gRPC/GraphQL/CLI/Native Endpoints

The OASIS API currently has a HTTP REST API, CLI & Native endpoints. gRPC & GraphQL are coming soon...

### Javascript, Unity & C# Packages

The OASIS API currently has a [Javascript](#javascript), [Unity](#unity) & [C#](#csharp) package, more are coming soon...

### Avatar API

The OASIS API features a powerful Avatar SSO (Single Sign On) API allowing ONE login across all your sites, games, apps, services, etc across all devices and platforms for your OASIS Avatar where you have FULL control of ALL of your data right down to the individual field level and whether each field is Replicated/Shared (ReadOnly) or Shared (ReadWrite). You no longer need to remember multiple login details, you can have just ONE login (avatar), that follows you everywhere and you have FULL control of. You choose where your data is stored and who has access to it. This avatar is the digital twin of YOU and allows you to earn/lose karma through the Karma API. 

### Karma API

The OASIS API also has a powerful Karma API where your avatar (YOU) can earn and lose karma across any OAPP (OASIS App) that is integrated into the OASIS API (websites, apps, games, services, etc). You can earn karma for picking up litter, recycling, going green, helping people, eating/drinking healthily, improving your self or the enviroment, donating to chairty, volunteering for good causes, planting trees, progressing in self help apps, medidation, yoga, mindfulness, spending time in nature, etc. You lose karma for dropping liter, being abusive online, not eating healthily. 

This karma is then redeemed for real world goods & services such as for a free smoothie, yoga class, retreat etc. 

It also unlocks new gifts and super powers for your avatar in the Our World/One World games that plug into the API, they are the first worlds of the new upcoming OASIS Omniverse (network of metaverses).

### Data API

It also features the powerful [Data API](https://www.ourworldthegame.com/single-post/web4-oasis-api-v2-3-1-released-with-new-improved-data-api-and-lots-more) allowing data to be shared between the above providers giving full interoperability. It also has powerful features such as auto-fail over, auto-load balancing and auto-replication across the providers so if one node goes down in your local area it will automatically switch to the next fastest node in your area independent of the network it belongs to, this way the OASIS API never has any downtime and will always be super fast and not reliant on only one network. This also applies for all the other API's such as the Avatar API etc. With unity consciousness the possibilities are limitless!

### SEEDS API

The OASIS API also has a SEEDS API allowing people to earn karma for donating and paying with Seeds (a new currency based on re-generating the planet) as well as when they invite or join Seeds. Read more here: https://joinseeds.earth/

### Keys/Wallet API

Finally it also features a new powerful Keys/Wallets API, which allows public private keys to be linked to your avatar per provider and private keys are only stored locally. Public keys and the rest of the wallet are stored on any provider (and auto-replicated across providers). Using the Avatar SSO you can also login using any of your public keys linked to your avatar (as well as either your username or email). You can also transfer tokens using any of these 3 so you do not need to ever worry about long meaningless public keys!

All of your wallets, bank accounts, PayPal, etc can be linked to your aggregated OASIS Wallet so you can see your full balance of assets and easily transfer between ANY of them with just one cick, gone are the days of having to painfully manage and transfer between mutiple wallets just to get access to your funds!

Because of the auto replication the private keys are automatically backed up to your local devices and can automatically sync between them so if you get a new device it can automatically sync with it, a bit like a decentralised offline cloud.

You will never lose your keys again! ;-)

It can also then sync your public key and wallet address etc when you go back online. With this architecture it opens the doors to many new use cases...

### Providers API

This allows users/admins to fully control and configure the full power of the OASIS API (ONODE's) such as auto-replication, auto-failover, auto load-balancing, providers, error handling, logging and so much more!

### Full Accountability/Zero Crime/Dark Net Prove

The extra benefit of this is that everyone is fully accountable for their actions where their karma & how they earnt/lost it is fully visible to all. There can be no hiding in the OASIS, it makes crime & the dark net impossible!

### Future Prove! Never Need To Learn A New Tech Stack/Language Again!

The OASIS API is very intuitive and easy to use hiding away the complexities of the lower-level networks/protocols/platforms/API's but at the same time gives full power and control to power users who wish to dive deeper into the lower-level tech. This also means you do not need to keep learning new tech/APIs/programming languages etc, from now on you only ever need to use the very intuitive powerful OASIS API and the rest is taken care of for you! Also, even if a newer version of one network/API comes out like Holochain RSM or Ethereum 2, you do not need to do anything to port your app to the latest version, the OASIS will take care of this for you. This saves you valuable time to focus on bringing your idea to life! Happy Days! :)

### Works Offline/Local Networks (LAN, Bluetooth, Mesh Networks)

This same technology works across all of the API's (Avatar, Data, etc) so you can work offline if your connection to the internet goes down and will automatically sync once it goes back online. It even allows you to network over LAN, Bluetooth, Mesh Networks, etc.

### OAPPS - Write Once, Deploy Everywhere
OAPP's (OASIS Apps) that use the OASIS API can be deployed anywhere across any network, platform, API or protocol. This includes all of WEB2 (clouds, databases, etc),  Holochain, every popular blockchain, ActivityPub, IPFS, SOLID & many more... check the growing list of providers supported below.

Gone are the days of having to write multiple dApps and having to spend lots of time setting up your dev environment for each one such as the network, wallet, account, etc. The OASIS API can manage all of this for you with one simple to use UI (web, desktop and Unity versions planned). The Unity UI will in fact be Our World and will be the most feature rich through the XR interface.

You can also of course fully manage every feature and option through the API itself so you could even write your own UI to it if you so wished.

### One API To Rule Them All - The GOD Protocol/API
The OASIS API will allow you to connect into everything including e-commerce, trading, security, social networks, blockchains, holochain networks, etc. regardless of where they are running (WEB2 or WEB3/IoT).

### Full Smart Contract Interoperability

Smart Contracts will be supported across any of the supported providers (network/platform/API/protocol), so you only need to write the contract once for your OAPP and then deploy your OAPP once and it will then take care of deploying and running your app/smart contract across all supported providers (network/platform/API/protocol).

### Powerful Pick n Mix & Plug n Play UI Components

Soon you will also have a very powerful intuitive UI allowing anyone to build an OAPP through a simple intuitive to use drag n drop interface plugging together the various components (web, unity, unreal, metaverse & more) you need allowing you to focus on your ideas rather than on how to implement them. This will lower the barrier to entry for non-technical people, the perfect low-code solution!

### WEB/2D/3D/AR/VR/IR/Map/Meta Visusalization

Each OAPP can have a Web, 2D, 3D AR, 3D VR, 3D Map, 3D IR ([Infinite Reality](https://www.ourworldthegame.com/single-post/beyond-xr-is-ir-infinite-reality)), 2D Map & Meta View. You will be able to switch between these at run-time.

### Our World Geo-Location/AR/IR/Map UI (Game Of Games Engine)

[Our World](http://www.ourworldthegame.com) is the first world in the infinite Omniverse (what comes after Metaverse). Our World also acts as the UI to the OASIS API allowing the various OAPP’s to have a 3D object/2D sprite representation on the 3D map of the world. They can then view meta data about the app as well as launch the app from within Our World (phase 1 of The OASIS you see in Ready Player One). Through the OASIS API people have a full geo-location API allowing them to fully control the 3D map, add quests, routes, sub-games, AR hotspots, and so much more. One possible use case would be Smart Cities amongst many more. 

[Our World](https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK#our-world-overview) is an exciting immersive next generation 3D XR/IR (Infinite Reality) educational game/platform/social network/ecosystem teaching people on how to look after themselves, each other and the planet using the latest cutting-edge technology. It teaches people the importance of real-life face to face connections with human beings and encourages them to get out into nature using Augmented Reality similar to Pokémon Go but on a much more evolved scale. This is our flagship product and is our top priority due to the massive positive impact it will make upon the world...

It is the XR/IR Gamification layer of the new interplanetary operating system & the new internet (Web 3.0), which is being built by the elite technical wizards stationed around the world. This will one day replace the current tech giants such as Google, FaceBook, etc and act as the technical layer of the New Earth, which is birthing now.  Unlike the current tech giants who's only aim is to ruthlessly maximize profits at the expense of people and the planet (as well as spying, exploitation, censorship & social engineering), our technology is based on true love & unity consciousness where money and profits are not our aim or intention, our aim and intention is to heal the entire planet & human race so we can all live in harmony with each other. It is a 5th dimensional and ascension training platform, teaching people vital life lessons as well as acting as a real-time simulation of the real world.

Our World is built on top of the de-centralised, distributed nextgen internet known as Holochain (but bridges to all other WEB2 & WEB3 sites/apps/games through the OASIS API).

The first phase of Our World will be a de-centralised distributed XR Gamified 3D Map replacement for Google Maps along with the Avatar/Profile/Karma & OASIS API system. The satellite apps/games will be able to create their own 2D/3D object to appear on the real-time 3D map.

[Check out the site](http://www.ourworldthegame.com) for more info.

https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-Smartphone-Prototype-AR

### IR (Infinite Reality) Ready

IR is what comes after AR, VR & XR. It is where the boundary between real and the virtual become one. More coming soon... ;-) 

### One World Open World MMO (VR) (Game Of Games Engine)

One World is Our World's cousin and is a Open World MMORPG set in the past allowing people to build whatever they can imagine unleashing their FULl creativity & potential! It uses bio-feedback technology allowing you to move objects with your mind with real force powers! :) You can also see other players avatar/chakras in real-time and so much more! You can medidate to make it rain to water your crops or to help your camp fire burn brighter! 

One World will be the first AAA MMO game and 2D/3D Social Network to run on HoloChain and the Blockchain. It will also be the first to integrate a social network with a MMO game/platform as well as all of these technologies and devices together. As with the rest of the game, it will be leading the way in what can be done with this NextGen Technology for the benefit and upliftment of humanity.

More news on this soon...

### XR/IR Unified Interface To The World

Our World & One World are like the XR/IR Unified Interface into all of these hApps/dAps/Websites/apps/games (this is the Operating System part of it), it's a bit like the XR UI front-end to Holochain/Blockchains/WEB2 where you can view and launch any app/website/game from inside it but they integrate much more deeper than that through the OASIS API/Profile/Avatar/Karma system where they all share the central avatar/profile and can all add/subtract the profiles/avatars karma.

Both One World (desktop/console) & Our World (smartphone) players can interact in real-time through time portals and much more...

### WEB 5 STAR OASIS Omniverse Interoperable Metaverse Low Code Generator

[The WEB 5 STAR OASIS Omniverse Interoperable Metaverse Low Code Generator](https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK#web5-star-odk) is built on top of the OASIS API and aggregates all the worlds data and expresses it within a cyberspace ontology using a cutting edge custom built ORM (Object Relational Mapper) called COSMIC. The STAR Omniverse is both a simulation & game of life and aggregates all metaverses into one fully integrated unified platform. It is also a fully integrated immersive interoperable metaverse Low Code Generator and soooooo much more.... ;-)

It connects and integrates all metaverses together through the SSO Avatar/Karma system (part of the OASIS API). It is also a fully interoperable Metaverse Low Code Generator (connecting all WEB 2 and WEB 3 together) through the WEB 4 OASIS API.

The STAR ODK, the heart of the OASIS can even compile OAPP's to native code for each platform, provider, network, etc. For example, for Holochain Provider it dynamically generates the low-level Rust code, which acts as the DAL (Data Access Layer). It also dynamically generates the C# code that runs on top of it abstracting away the lower-level complexities and this acts as the BLL (Business Logic Layer). This has the additional benefit that you can now debug your app logic in C#, something you cannot do in rust. It also allows you to have the best of both worlds by giving you access to both rust and C# libraries. The possibilities are endless, time to unleash YOUR full potential!

### AI/Machine Learning Over All Of World's Aggregated Data

Both WEB 4 & WEB 5 use machine learning AI to analyse all of the worlds data to generate useful insights, predictions & so much more!

### Summary

To summarize, WEB4 OASIS API aggregates all of the worlds data into a fully unified API to allow better sense making to made, which then feeds into WEB5 STAR, which expresses it in a cyberspace ontology and connects the worlds data to the rest of the COSMOS and Galaxy... ;-)

## The OASIS API & Karma System

Our World is much more than just a free open world game where you can build and create anything you can imagine and at the same time be immersed in an epic storyline. it is an entirely new ecosystem/asset store/internet, it is the future way we will be interacting with each other and the world through the use of technology. Smaller satellite apps/game will plug into it and share your central profile/avatar where you gain karma for doing good deeds such as helping your local communities, etc and lose karma for being selfish and not helping others since it mirrors the real world where you have free will. The karma unlocks certain abilities, special powers & items you can purchase in the game as well as quests and new areas to explore. 

We believe that the OASIS API & Karama System should be baked into the core of the new internet (Web 3.0+) that we are co-creating and will allow [Everything to talk to Everything](https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK#bridge) else and will act as the worlds universal API/protocol. At the center of this is the central profile/avatar where the user's data will be stored. Part of this data will include the karma they have earnt in Our World as well as the karma they have earnt in any of the inter-connected satellite apps/games that use the OASIS API.

This will increase peoples awareness of the good or bad karma they are collecting and will help them become more conscious of their moment by moment actions. This will help them strive to become a better person and to reach their full potential doing as much good as they can in the world. This will help manifest a better world for us all that much faster, when everyone is doing all they can to help co-create it.

Check out the latest <a href="https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK/blob/master/NextGenSoftware.OASIS.API.ONODE.WebAPI/OASIS%20API%20RELEASE%20HISTORY.md">WEB 4 OASIS API RELEASE HISTORY</a>.

**The OASIS API & Our World are expressions of true Unity Consciousness manifested within the technical sphere.**

The karma will be grouped into the following categories:

| Karma Type  | Description |
|--|--|
| Our World | Earnt by completing quests within Our Word itself.  |
| Self Help/Improvement | Earnt by helping people in Our World or in any other app/game/website. This could include counselling, healing, giving advice on a social network, donating, etc
| Helping People | Earnt by helping people in Our World or in any other app/game/website. This could include counselling, healing, giving advice on a social network, donating, etc
| Helping The Environment | Earnt by helping the environment such as planting a tree, saving the rain forest, campaigning to save your local park, picking up litter, cleaning up the ocean, etc
| Helping Animals | Earnt by helping animals such as donating to a animal shelter or charity.
| Contributing Towards A Good Cause - Contributor | Writing content for any good cause. This could also creating audio (podcast,etc) or video (YouTube,etc)
| Contributing Towards A Good Cause - Sharer | Sharing a good cause (including any content such as blogs, video etc).
| Contributing Towards A Good Cause - Administrator | Doing admin work for a good cause. If it is non-paid then you earn even more karma.
| Contributing Towards A Good Cause - Creator/Organiser | Organising/creating a good cause (this will give you more karma than the other good cause categories) | 
| Contributing Towards A Good Cause - Funder | Donate to a good cause/charity.
| Contributing Towards A Good Cause - Speaker | Do public speaking for a good cause.
| Contributing Towards A Good Cause - Peaceful Protester/Activist| Attending a peaceful protest to being about positive change in the world. |
| Other | Anything else not covered above.

The list above is subject to change with more categories likely to be added later as the system evolves and matures...

Sometimes you may earn karma in multiple categories for one action such as by donating to a animal shelter you will earn karma for both **Helping Animals** and for **Contributing Towards A Good Cause - Funder**. 

You will be able to see how the karma you have earnt is broken down into these categories on the users profile/avatar. Various quests, special powers, abilities, items, locations, etc will unlock once you have reached a certain minimum karma level. If you fall below that level by losing karma then they will become locked again. The minimum karma level would normally be your total karma level but it could also be a combination of the various karma categories above. For example to enter a special mystic temple in Our World you may need a total karma level of 1000, karma level of 500 in Self Help/Improvement & 500 karma level for Our World. You could need a karma level of 300 for Helping Animals to access a secret animal sanctuary within Our World.

You will also be able to view the karma levels of other users, this can help you reach out to them to help improve their karma in categories they are lacking in by inviting them on a Quest with you or your group. 

<a name="your-karma-level-effects-your-real-life-too-"></a>
### Your Karma Level Effects Your Real Life Too!

Your karma level effects your real life too, for example you may be entitled to free upgrades at shows, flights, events, hotels, etc. You may also be entitled to special discounts in shops, etc and if you have enough karma you can get free holidays, etc too. The higher your karma the more society will reward you. The list is endless of what is possible. We envision that eventually this will be deeply  integrated into all of society. This reflects how the Universe actually works and is part of the real-time simulation aspect of Our World.

### Gain Karma When You Earn HoloFuel For Sharing Your Nodes Resources To Power Our World

You can also gain karma for sharing your node's resources such as CPU, memory, bandwidth, etc

### The OASIS API Will Use The Reputation Interchange From Sacred Capital

We have partnered with Sacred Capital (another great Holochain project) to use the Reputation Interchange to help power the Karma system across the Holochain Ecosystem and beyond...

https://www.sacred.capital


<a name="open-karma-committee-community-concensors"></a>
### Open Karma Committee/Community Concensors

There will be a Open Karma Committer who will decide the algorithms for karma allocation through concensors with the community. The community can vote for any proposals the committee publish and only ones which receive enough votes will be made "OASIS Law". The community can also vote in representatives to sit on the committee so it is as open and democratic as possible.

**We wish to empower the community to feel into their own hearts for what is right for them. We want them to own the system.**

### The OASIS API Enables You To Earn Karma Anywhere

Our World will automatically support all of the platforms/networks/protocols listed above so your profile/avatar/karma will be available to any apps that use their platforms/networks/protocols. This will also make it easier to earn karma in a wider range of apps by supporting as many platforms/networks/protocols as possible. 

### Machine Learning Algorithms, Models & AI
Our World uses Machine Learning Alogrithms & Models to rate how positive comments are and then reward karma for positive comments and lose karma for negative comments. This is used in the social media part and chat, etc... We plan to make use of machine learning in many other parts of Our World as well as developing other advanced AI components in collaboration with the S7 Foundation.

<a name="the-universal-api-to-connect-everything-to-everything--no-more-silos-walled-gardens-"></a>
### The Universal API To Connect Everything To Everything (No More Silos/Walled Gardens)

**The OASIS API is a global universal API that aims to connect everything to everything to eliminate walled gardens/silos.** There are a number of open protocols/platforms/networks (such as Gab, Mastodon, Diaspora, WebFinger, SOLID, Holochain, CEPTR Pluggable Protocol, Ethereum, Fediverse, ActivityPub, XMPP & more!) that the OASIS API will support. The majority of these are aimed at building a truly decentralised distributed internet (Web 3/0/4.0/5.0) and this is also the aim of the OASIS API. 

<a name="oapps---write-once--deploy-everywhere"></a>
### OAPPS - Write Once, Deploy Everywhere

OAPP's (OASIS Apps) that use the OASIS API can be deployed anywhere across any network, platform, API or protocol. This includes Holochain, every popular blockchain, ActivityPub, IPFS, SOLID & many more... check the growing list of providers supported below..

Gone are the days of having to write multiple dApps and having to spend lots of time setting up your dev environment for each one such as the network, wallet, account, etc. The OASIS API can manage all of this for you with one simple to use UI (web, desktop and Unity versions planned). The Unity UI will in fact be Our World and will be the most feature rich through the XR interface.

You can also of course fully manage every feature and option through the API itself so you could even write your own UI to it if you so wished.

<a name="oapps---full-cross-api-support-across-all-networks-platforms-apis-protocols"></a>
### OAPPS - Full Cross-API Support Across All Networks/Platforms/APIs/Protocols

OAPP's that use the OASIS API can access all API functions of the various supported providers (networks/platforms/APIs/Protocols) through a simple asbstraction layer built on top of them. Gone are the days of having to learn many API's, you only need to learn one... the OASIS API and it will take care of the rest for you... happy days! :) 

You can of course still call through to a specefic provider API if you still need to or need greater control over that specefic provider.

<a name="oapps---full-support--create-deploy-consume--for-smart-contracts--solidity--across-any-supported-provider--network-platform-api-protocol-"></a>
### OAPPS - Full support (create/deploy/consume) for Smart Contracts (SOLIDITY) across ANY supported Provider (Network/platform/API/protocol)

Smart Contracts will be supported across any of the supported providers (network/platform/API/protocol), so you only need to write the contract once for your OAPP and then deploy your OAPP once and it will then take care of deploying and running your app/smart contract across all supported providers (network/platform/API/protocol).

<a name="one-api-to-rule-them-all---abstraction-layer-over-the-new-distributed-decentralised-internet--iot-"></a>
### One API To Rule Them All - Abstraction Layer Over The New Distributed Decentralised Internet (IoT)

The OASIS API will allow you to connect into everything including e-commerce, trading, security, social networks, blockchains, holochain networks, etc.

<a name="oasis-api-can-manage-all-of-your-tokens-exchanges-wallets-all-in-one-place"></a>
### OASIS API Can Manage All Of Your Tokens/Exchanges/Wallets All In One Place

The OASIS API will allow you to easily manage all of your tokens/exchanges/wallets in one place with a simple to use API. You will also be able to manage them through the OASIS API UI (web, desktop & Unity).
The OASIS API will allow you to easily manage all of your tokens/exchanges/wallets in one place with a simple to use API. You will also be able to manage them through the OASIS API UI (web, desktop & Unity).

<a name="one-single-login-for-all-your-apps-games-websites-services-everything-"></a>
### One Single Login For All Your Apps/Games/Websites/Services/Everything!

Your central profile/avatar from Our World is shared through the OASIS API to all your connecting satillite apps/games/websites/services, which means you only need to login once on any device and never again! Gone are the days of having to remember countless logins for all your different apps/games/websites/services. Happy days! :)

<a name="our-world-is-the-xr-ir-unified-interface-to-the-holochain-ecosystem"></a>
### Our World Is The XR/IR Unified Interface To The Holochain Ecosystem

Our World is like a XR/IR Unified Interface into all of these hApps (this is the Operating System part of it), it's a bit like the XR UI front-end to Holochain where you can view and launch any apps from inside it but they integrate much more deeper than that through the OASIS API/Profile/Avatar/Karma system where they all share the central avatar/profile and can all add/subtract the profiles/avatars karma.


<a name="satellite-apps-games-websites--consumers-"></a>
### Satellite Apps/Games/Websites/Services (Consumers)

As already mentioned, many satellite apps/games/websites will plug into Our World using the OASIS API. They can choose to just share the central avatar/profile and the karma system or they can choose to also define the 2D Sprite or 3D object that will appear in Our World at the geo-location specified through the API. This will be the visual representation of the app/game/website/organisation and when the player either walks into or interacts with (click, touch, etc) it will display info and meta data passed through the API. The player can then choose to launch the app/game/website from within Our World.

A list of of possible early adopters can be found below:

### Holochain Zomes/Services Used

Below is a list of all the Holochain zomes/services used by Our World/The OASIS API:

| Zome/Service | Description  | Integrated
|--|--|--|
| <a href="https://www.sacred.capital">Sacred Capital</a> |Our staking protocol allows network effects to accrue to reputation. We achieve this through a process known as 'Contextual Chaos'. This means you can port reputation across eco-systems in an appropriate and contextual manner.The result? Applications that facilitate new behavior patterns of collaboration, interaction and sharing. This is the new economy coming alive in it's truest, varied, diverse colours! We will be using their Reputation Interchange to help power the Karma System | Coming Soon|
| <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/pad">Holo-REA</a> |The HoloREA team wants to create a framework for developing economic networks on Holochain. HoloREA will build some apps, but also intends the framework to be usable by any other apps that work in economic networks, supply chains, or joint ventures.  We will be using their framework to help power the in-app transactions as well as the supply chain & e-commerce components of Our World.| Coming Soon|

|InvestorEngine| Will be an excellent platform that can help generate some much needed funds for Our World! ;-) |
|CleFree - To copyright Our World on their blockchain tech (they currently use blockstack but will switch to holochain when its in beta).

### Calling The OASIS API

The OASIS API can be called using a number of ways:

| Method | Description  |
|--|--|
|GraphQL/Apollo  | This will be the main way of calling the API since it provides a really nice JSON formatted syntax to make calls across the various OASIS Providers. This will be done over a web socket.   |
|REST API | This will be the fall back way to call the API if for whatever reason the GraphQL option is not available.
| Embedded DLL | If the client is .NET or Unity (or anything that supports importing a .NET compilled DLL) then they can make calls directly though the [OASIS Interfaces](#interfaces) or the various Managers in the [OASIS API Core](#using-the-oasis-api-core).


### OASIS Open Standards

The OASIS API is all about pushing the Open Source & Open Community standards. As almost a sign we were on the right path we recently discovered this site:

https://www.oasis-open.org

They are all about pushing the same agenda except we are actually implementing a API to achieve our shared goals of getting everything to talk to everything else. It's very interesting we both chose the name OASIS, a coincidence or not? ;-) We are obviously in the process of reaching out to them to see how we can work together...

<a name="oasis-api-redundancy--can-store-copies-of-your-data-on-any-decentralised-network-platform-you-choose-"></a>
### OASIS API Redundancy (Can Store Copies Of Your Data On Any Decentralised Network/Platform You Choose)

The OASIS API has built in redundancy in that you can choose to store copies of your data on any decentralised network/platform. When calling the OASIS API you can specify which network/platform you wish to use (the ones available will be dependent on whether a Provider has yet been implemented for it, so far only Holochain is supported.) The default provider will be Holochain since the long term goal of the OASIS API is to get people to slowly migrate across to Holochain.


### User Has FULL Control Of Their Data

Any other OAPP (that uses the OASIS API) can also choose to share your profile/avatar/karma with any of the supported platforms/networks/protocols. The user will have fully access and control of where their data can be stored/shared along with granular permissions such as which apps/sites/users/groups/roles/networks/platforms can see what.

**More to come soon...**

<a name="the-oasis-network--onet-"></a>
## The OASIS Network (ONET)

The OASIS Network (ONET) is the distributed de-centralised network allowing the various providers that the OASIS API supports to be fully distributed globally across a large decentralised network. This builds on top of design principles from Holocahin in that it is fully distributed and there is no centralisation or bottlenecks (other than of course potential ones caused by Blockchains but the design should hopefully help alleviate these as much as possible). 

<a name="rest-api--graphql---websockets-supported"></a>
### REST API, GraphQL & WebSockets Supported

- Clients connect to various ONODE Providers through their selected ONODE CORE Gateway.

- Clients connect through their web browser using either REST, WS or GraphQL similar to Holoports except they only use WS as far as I know.

- If the client is an app or unity game it will connect directly using the REST, WS or GraphQL API's. 

<a name="rest-api--graphql---websockets-supported"></a>
### Can Run On The Holo Network

- It can use Holo Hosting to run ONODE's (OASIS API REST Service/GraphQL Server/WS endpoint) along with any ONODE Providers such as Blockchain, SOLID, IPFS, AcitivtyPub, legacy, etc

<a name="earn-karma---holofuel-for-running-a-onode"></a>
### Earn Karma & HoloFuel For Running a ONODE

- People earn Karma & HoloFuel for running the ONODE's (the more node's they run the more karma & HoloFuel they can earn).


### ONODE Setup

- ONODE Setup wizard for HoloPorts, Windows, Mac, Linux, XBOX ONE, PS4, etc. (will allow CPU, memory, disk & network storage/loads to be fully distributed)

- Windows will be first, quickly followed by Linux & Mac thanks to .NET CORE making it easy to deploy to them. HoloPorts (NixOS) will also be a priority once these have stabilised & the Altha Open TestNet has been successful and is stable. We may wait till the beta mainnet but will know closer to the time...

- ONODE Setup will install a lightweight webserver running REST API, Apollo Server (Node.js) & WebSocket Endpoint. It will also connect and configure ONODE Providers for whatever is found running on the ONODE device such as Holochain, Ethereum, IPFS, ActivityPub, SOLID, etc.

- There will be an option to download and install various Providers when installing, as well as the option to connect & configure a provider later.

- Can run remote distributed providers so they do not all need to be on the same device. This will help distribute the CPU, Memory, Network & Disk loads (Blockchains can be very high!)

- People also earn Krama & HoloFuel for running the distributed providers.


### Detailed Management Console

- There will be a detailed Management Console allowing the user to view network traffic, where the data is being stored (both for the user & node), OAPP's installed, Providers Installed/Connected (both local & remote), uptime, karma/holofuel earnt & lots more!

<a name="onode-core---onode-providers"></a>
### ONODE CORE & ONODE Providers

- A ONODE CORE Gateway can run multiple ONODE Providers either locally or remotely.

- Can run only one ONODE CORE instance but you can run multiple instances of the ONODE Providers, which may be able to help reduce various Blockchain bottlenecks, etc. Holochain does not suffer from these issues.

- ONODE Core can manage and load balance the various Providers keeping throughput as optimal as possible.

- When adding a ONODE Provider you can select whether it is local or remote.

- When installing & setting up a OASIS ONODE you can select if it will be a ONODE CORE or a ONODE Provider. If it will be a ONODE Provider then you need to enter the address of the ONODE CORE to connect to. ONODE CORE are a bit like controllers or gateways.

<a name="encourages-people-to-self-organise--co-operate--co-ordinate---promotes-a-decentralised-distributed-mindset"></a>
### Encourages People To Self-Organise, Co-operate, Co-ordinate & Promotes A Decentralised Distributed Mindset.

-  Reason it makes sense for people to self-organise & not everyone run a ONODE CORE is because the OAPP's that want to share to multiple providers will pick the ONODE's with the most providers as possible and it would be rare for a ONODE CORE to run all of the providers on the same device due to the large amount of resources this would take (running multiple blockchain networks nodes would require huge amounts of storage space just for starters). So this will encourage a decentralised distributed architecture along with co-ordination, co-operations, team work and a distributed de-centralised mindset. :)

- Another incentive is that you actually earn more Karma & HoloFuel for running a distributed ONODE Provider over a local one. The same goes for the ONODE CORE, who will earn more karma/holofuel for connecting to and using distributed ONODE Providers over a local one.

- Distributed ONODE's are likely to be faster and have less bottlenecks. We want to move away from a centralisation mindset! ;-)

<a name="sharing---storing-your-data"></a>
### Sharing & Storing Your Data

- If a client wishes to share their profile/data to other providers this can be done without having to install any ONODE Providers on their device but if they wish to store the data locally on their device then of course they will need to install the respective ONODE Providers.

- Your profile will only be available to you on your devices across your apps.

- Will add a FileOASIS Storage Provider to serialise and save your profile to your local device such as smartphone if you do not have the space or processing power to install/run any other providers such as hc, blockchain, etc. This will likely still go through the ONODE Core Gateway (the hope is to make this as lightweight as possible so can run no problem on your phone). HC is also pretty lightweight so hopefully this will also be on phones in future then the FileOASIS Provider may not be needed because your profile would be stored in your local chain instead.

- You will be able to choose right down to individual field level what you wish to be stored/shared on each provider.

- You can share to one of the following: Public, Friends, Family, Colleagues, CustomList.

- When a profile is shared, it is similar to store but will be in a ReadOnly state and will appear in the appropriate list (family, friends, etc) on their respective OAPP's that use the OASIS API.

## OAPP Web UI Components

Each OAPP will have access to a number of templates, scarrolding & Web components (including React, Angular,  Pure/Vanilla JS & more!) to render:

  - Your Profile/Avatar (Embeedded 3D WebGL Model) - includes karma and how you got it, where & what OAPP.
  - Family/Friends/Co-workers lists.
  - Simple Messaging.
  - Launch Our World.
  - Launch OAPP (list of installed OAPP's).
  - If there is a location (such as a business, organisation, etc) for how you earnt your karma then there will be a "Show In Our World Map" option.
  - If a OAPP has a location associated with it then it will also have a "Show In Our World Map".
  
**More to come soon...**
  
## .NET HDK

We will soon also begin work on the .NET HDK to open up the amazing Holochain to the massive .NET & Unity ecosystem's, which will help turbocharge the holochain ecosystem they are trying to build...

.NET supports compiling to WASM so we know this is possible... ;-)

We are looking for devs who would be interested in this exciting mini-project, so if you are interested please get in touch either on the channel below or by emailing us on ourworld@nextgensoftware.co.uk or david@nextgensoftware.co.uk. We look forward to hearing from you! :)

https://chat.holochain.org/appsup/channels/net-hdk 

https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Holochain-.NET-HDK

A placeholder has also been added for the work to begin in this repo in the project Holochain.NextGenSoftware.HoloNET.HDK. Just as with NextGenSoftware.Holochain.HoloNET.Client, this project may be split out into its own repo and then linked to this one as a sub-module in future...

We have been tracking a number of different solutions to allow .NET to compile to WASM and the most promising so far is CoreRT (a AOT (Ahead Of Time) Compiler for .NET Core):

https://github.com/dotnet/corert/blob/master/Documentation/how-to-build-WebAssembly.md

This will allow managed C# code to be compiled into any native language including WASM.

<a name="the-power-of-holochain--net--unity---nodejs-combined-"></a>
## The Power Of Holochain, .NET, Unity & NodeJS Combined!

The front-end is built in Unity, the middle layer is built in C#/.NET and the back-end is built-in Holochain. 

<a name="web5-star-odk"></a>
## WEB5 STAR ODK (OASIS Developer Kit) Omniverse Interoperable Metaverse Low Code Generator

WEB 5 OASIS STAR OMNIVERSE is built on top of the OASIS API & .NET HDK and aggregates all the worlds data and expresses it within a cyberspace ontology using a cutting edge custom built ORM (Object Relational Mapper) called COSMIC. The STAR Omniverse is both a simulation & game of life and aggregates all metaverses into one fully integrated unified platform. It is also a fully integrated immersive interoperable metaverse Low Code Generator and soooooo much more.... ;-)

Both WEB 4 & WEB 5 use machine learning AI to analyse all of the worlds data to generate useful insights, predictions & so much more!

To summarize, WEB4 OASIS API aggregates all of the worlds data into a fully unified API to allow better sense making to made, which then feeds into WEB5 STAR, which expresses it in a cyberspace ontology and connects the worlds data to the rest of the COSMOS and Galaxy... ;-)
	
The STAR ODK, the heart of the OASIS can even compile OAPP's to native code for each platform, provider, network, etc. For example, for Holochain Provider it dynamically generates the low-level Rust code, which acts as the DAL (Data Access Layer). It also dynamically generates the C# code that runs on top of it abstracting away the lower-level complexities and this acts as the BLL (Business Logic Layer). The possibilities are endless, time to unleash YOUR full potential!

Here are some diagrams that will soon be written up properly:

STAR stands for Synergiser Transformer/Translator Aggregator Resolver. 

**Synergiser** - This is because it synergises all of what is out there including all tech, the entire worlds content, models of the Universe, us, creation, etc. 

**Transformer/Translator**- Due to it transforming and translating the data between different OASIS Providers and into one unified language (COSMIC ORM), which is how you talk to STAR.

**Aggregator** - Due to it aggerating all the data together and into one unified model of all and into one unified language (COSMIC ORM).

**Resolver** - This is because it resolves all of the data one one format to another as well as into the one unified language (COSMIC ORM),


As part of this we have been building it's very own ORM (Object Relational Mapping) system as an abstraction layer over all the OASIS Providers (whole Internet eventually). This ORM is called COSMIC (Computer Object-Orientated Super-Synergistic Machine Interface Code). It supports the same features as many popular ORM's such as change-management, version control, change tracking, etc.

What makes it pretty cool and unique (other than all the other exciting features above) is that is is modelled on Life! The root object is the Omiverse, this contains multiple multiverses, each of these contains dimensions. the 3rd dimension contains parallel Universes. Each Universe contains Galaxies, SloarSystems, Stars, SuperStars, GrandSuperStars, GreatGrandSuperStar, Planets, Moons, Stargates, Wormholes, Blackholes, Nebulas, Portals, Comets, Meteoroid's, Asteroids, Cosmic Rays, Galactic Waves, Cosmic Waves, Gravitational Waves, SpaceTime Distortion's, Temporal Rift's, Stardust, SpaceTime Abnormalities etc. The first Planet created is Our World and it's moons are the satellite apps/games/websites (OAPP's) that plug into it sharing the central avatar/karma system. Each celestial body (moon, planet, star, etc) are also OAPP's (OASIS Applications).

Stars, SuperStars, GrandSuperStars & the GreatGrandSuperStar create the contents of all of the OASIS Omiverse/Magicverse. They can also be used to jump around/navigate the Omierse through Multiverses/Universes, Galaxies, Dimensions, etc.

**Stars** - Can be at the centre of a Solar System (or without any Planets or Moons). Can create moons & planets within it's SolarSystem,

**SuperStars** - At the centre of a Galaxy. Can create SolarSytems, Stars, Planets & Moons within it's Galaxy. SuperStars are also used to jump from one Galaxy to another or to different dimensions within it's Universe.

**GrandSuperStar** - At the centre of each Multiverse/Universe. Can create Galaxies, SuperStars, Stars, Planets & Moons within it's Universe. GrandSuperStars are also used to jump from one Multiverse/Universe to another but may only access dimensions 1-7. 

**GreatGrandSuperStar** - There is ever only one of these in the OASIS and is at the centre of the Omiverse. This can create Multiverses (containing Universes), Galaxies, GrandSuperStars, SuperStars, Stars, Planets & Moons within it's Universe. The GreatGrandSuperStar can also be used to jump from one Multiverse/Universe anywhere within the Omiverse including all higher dimensions (8 - 12).


ONODE's can host any of the various Star types above depending on how much processing power/network bandwidth, etc each Node has. A OASIS ONODE can be running any number of OASIS Providers.

This is what forms the STAR NET, and this is what powers the HoloNET/ONET (OASIS Network).

You of course earn karma for hosing and the more you host and the bigger Star you are, the more karma you will be rewarded as well as SEEDS and HoloFuel. 

To begin with users Avatars can only create Moons, but as they level up and earn more karma they can create their own planets and eventually Stars, Galaxies and even entire Universes! Yes, this really is the beginning of the TRUE OASIS! ;-) This is like a God training programme! :)

Most of the back-end/ontology/object model has now been built, we just have a few more features to add, then lots of testing, bug fixing. Then we will be finishing of the Web Assembly templates/prototypes started last year (full stack Web Assembly). STAR can generate code for any target platform/use case such as website, game, app, service, etc.

You no longer need to keep learning new stacks, API's, languages, the OASIS API/STAR/COSMIC abstracts all of this away for you. You just need to write your OAPP once and it will be future prove, for ever! :) No more need to get porting to newer versions of Holochain or any other stack! :) As new tech emerges a new OASIS Provider can be added, which will automatically take advantage of it. The OASIS gives you the best of all the tech out there through a very powerful yet simple to use intuitive API/SDK abstracting away all the lower stack complexities. It also allows you to dig deeper into the lower stacks if you are a power user.

We have also built an advanced STAR CLI with its own powerful sub-engine. So as you can see we have been VERY busy and hence the radio silence! ;-)

In the past few months we have written over 100K lines of code! ;-)

The OASIS is really starting to take shape now, but much as with NextGen tech it is taking a LOT longer than originally anticipated, as I am sure Holochain know how that feels too! ;-) It's not easy being ahead of the curve going where no man has gone before blazing a path for others to follow! There isn't really much resources you can call on for help because there is nothing else out there like it! ;-)

We started off building the digital twin of you (the Avatar Karma System back in 2019) along with the digital twin of our planet called Our World (we started doing R&D, research, designing, prototyping back in 2011). It then expanded into the digital twin of our Solar System when STAR was born last year on Lions Gate (8th Aug). Since then it has continued to expand and what we are now building is the digital twin for all of creation, no small task! ;-) 

We were deeply inspired by Holochain & Noomap/Holomap/HoloWeb modelling nature so we have taken this to the next level. Each OAPP still contains Zomes (modules), the data objects used are Holons and EVERY single object in the OASIS inherits from a base Holon object. What we are now building with STAR is like the Holochain/HoloWeb/,NET HDK/OASIS love child! :)

It is very hard to put into words what we are building but I hope this gives you a bit more of an idea... ;-)

You may recall in Ready Player One, that the OASIS is a "**SIMULATION**", it is not just another VR game/platform... well that is what we are building, a SIMILATION, it mimics all of creation from the macrocosm right down to the microcosm. The Omiverse is inside us all so yes you can access the Omiverse from within each of your Avatars... we are merging and unifying all current earth science along with spiritual/galactic information/downloads and beyond... ;-) 

We truly are creating the most accurate Unified Model there is of all there is....
	
We are building the architecture/platform to allow everything to integrate and play with everything else... completely removing all silos once and for all... you could have a Holochain Galaxy, a EOSIO Galaxy, etc or even entire Universes (depending on the size of the ecosystems). The OASIS has been built from the ground up with MAXIMUM inter-operability in mind with EVERYTHING, so it is not something that has been crowbarred in as a after thought. It is outside of all existing blockchain/tech understandings and concepts, it has been designed from the outside looking in using a new novel/intuitive way, which others may not have seen being on the inside... 

So yes as you can see it has grown way beyond the .NET HDK now! ;-) And hence the delays...

### Node.JS Integration

The OASIS Architecture will interface to Node.JS using Edge.js:

https://github.com/tjanczuk/edge

This will allow both .NET and NodeJS to run in the same process and make cross function calls as if they were native.

<a name="turbocharge-the-holochain-ecosystem-"></a>
## Turbocharge the Holochain ecosystem!

Because the OASIS Architecture makes use of .NET, Unity, NodeJS & Holochain we have access to 3 massive well established ecosystems along with all their devs & resources. This will massively help turbocharge the holochain ecosystem as well as help raise awareness of it...


## The OASIS Architecture

The Architecture diagram can be found below or on our website (http://www.ourworldthegame.com) but it is also in the images folder of the repo cunningly named OASIS Architecture Diagram.png

![alt text](https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK/blob/master/Images/OASIS%20Arcitecture.png "OASIS Architecture Diagram")

Our World will run on our own propriety game engine called OASIS 2.0 (Open Advanced Sensory Immersion System).

Our World will run on a secure, distributed and de-centralized architecture where user’s data will be stored on their machine and not a central server enabling the user to own their data, meaning it cannot be sold or exploited as others do. It will do this by running on a new nextgen Internet known as Holochain.

Our World will run on its own private secure network called ONET (OASIS Network) on top of HoloChain offering yet more security and performance benefits. It will not suffer from any bottlenecks as is the case with the current centralised server architecture in current games causing lag, which is very frustrating to gamers and can mean life or death in games.

Our World/OASIS & ONET can even distribute the computing power across the gamers machines so if some machines are struggling, they can borrow processing power from fellow gamers with more powerful rigs (if they give permission of course!). Sounding like the OASIS from Ready Player One (book version) yet? ;-)

It will also run on IPFS, Ethereum, Solana, EOS, Holochain, MongoDB, Neo4j, SQLLite, ThreeFold, SOLID and many more!

**Our World will run on all of WEB2 and WEB3 via the WEB4 OASIS API**

**It will also allow any HApp, HoloChain App, DApp, SOLID App to plug into Our World where they can share their data (as well as connect to the central avatar/profile) or even their full UI within the Our World VR/AR/XR/IR (Infinite Reality) world/universe. It will also allow any other legacy apps/games/systems to plug in using a HTTP API that implements the OAPI (OASIS API). It will act as the bridge between all the upcoming nextgen technology as well as supporting legacy systems until they are also migrated to the new nextgen internet**

**All of these apps that plug into the OASIS Engine (Our World) will be known as OApps (OASIS Apps). As well as these OApps being able to share their data/UI with any other OApp, they can also take advantage of the OASIS Asset Store where users can buy various add-ons for your app/game.**

**By supporting everything Our World/OASIS will help act as a bridge between the old and the new world.**

NextGen Software & Our World themselves will also be a DAO (Distributed Anonymous Organisation) registered with DAOStack meaning we can self-govern and cut out the expensive middlemen such as banks, lawyers, accountants, managers, contracts etc. This technology will allow us to realise our long-held dreams of running a flat decentralised organisation where every voice is heard, respected and is counted as an equal. This also prevents fraud, mistakes and corruption from occurring as is all too common now days.

**NOTE: The design is evolving all the time so the above is subject to change...**

### Open Modular Design

As you can see from the diagram the OASIS architecture is very modular, open and extensible meaning any component can easily be swapped out for another without having to make any changes to the rest of the system. It will use MEF (Managed Extensibility Framework) so the components can even be swapped out without having to re-compile any of the existing code, you simply drop the new component into a hot folder that the system will pick up on the next time you restart.

The components are split into 11 sub-systems/layers:

* Storage ([IOASISStorage](#ioasisstorage) Interface)
* Network ([IOASISNET](#ioasisnet) Interface)
* Renderer (IOASIS2DRenderer & IOASIS3DRenderer Interfaces)
* XR/Eye Tracking
* Haptic Feedback
* Realtime Emotional Feedback System
* Face Recognition
* Motion Tracking
* Input
* OAPP Templates
* [OASIS Engine/API](#oasisapicore)

Currently [HoloOASIS](#holooasis) implements the [IOASISStorage](#ioasisstorage) and [IOASISNET](#ioasisnet) interfaces.

**PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU READ THE DESCRIPTION BOXES ON THE DIAGRAM FOR MORE INFO ON HOW THE SYSTEM WILL WORK.**

Below are the copies of the description boxes found on the diagram, which some may find easier to read...

### General

This is an example implementation of the OASIS/OAPP Stack using the Unity game engine, HTC Vive VR headset, Oculus Rift VR headset, Apple ARKit, Google ARCore & Haptor VR Haptic feedback gloves. The smartphone version will be using Unity so its stack will look similar to this. The desktop/console version will likely be using the Cry Engine.

As you can see the system is highly modular so it supports any combination of components and allows for each to be swapped out for another without having to re-write the core game logic. The system can also be easily extended and adapted in future without expensive time consuming re-writes, it also will not break existing components and apps since the core API's will remain the same. This is done by following the standard good practise design principles such as SOLID. This also allows for each component to be developed and tested independently and removes any inter-dependencies making the system more stable, robust and easier to maintain. You are not forced to implement all of the interfaces below, only those you wish to use, the system is highly redundant and will still continue to work with whatever has been implemented and configured.

An OAPP has the choice to implement whatever interfaces they wish. They can choose to implement the various renderer, AR,VR, HapicFeedback, Input interfaces, etc (which Our World implements) or just the IOAPP interface, which will expose just the central avatar/profile where they can commit additional karma if they do good deeds in the app. A number of default implementations/templates will be provided for H4OME (HAPP), Holochain (hAPP), Ethereum (DAPP) and a simple HTTP Client, all of which will be implemented as extendable base classes & boiler plate/scaffolding code so the app developer can easily extend the out of the box basic functionality. This will enable developers to be as productive as possible within the OASIS System. They can also optionally choose to implement additional methods/interfaces if they wish to display a UI within Our World. In time simple wizards will also be provided to guide the developer through the creation of their app using simple step by step instructions.

<a name="oasiswebportal--noomap-interface"></a>
### OASISWEBPORTAL/ NOOMAP INTERFACE

As well as the smartphone and console/desktop version of Our World, there will also be a web portal, which will be a nextgen social network and will also interact with the central profile/avatar. Part of this will also include the Match Need System allowing them to search the Internet for products/services/info that will help improve their wellbeing where the results will be tailored to their current wellbeing requirements stored in their profile/central avatar.The user will be able to choose to visualise this in a traditional 2D interface or a nextgen 3D/VR interace partly powered by Noomap/S7 Foundation technology & WebGL. It will also use the IOAPP interface to communicate to the OASIS Engine/Profile/Avatar. It will also be an example of how to use the  HTTPOASISAPP template, since it will be built on top of it.

<a name="ioapp--oapp-"></a>
### IOAPP (OAPP)

The minimum API which a OAPP needs to implement to interact with the OASIS/Our World system. This will enable them to just access the central profile/avatar and also grant additional karma for good deeds, etc.

<a name="our-world"></a>
### Our World

Our World is an example of the first OAPP. It is also the UI for the OASIS ecosystem which all OAPP's plug into. If the OAPP has implemented the UI interfaces above it will appear in Our World. The UI can be implemented as anything they wish ranging from a simple object, shop, area, city, region, country, continent, planet, Galaxy or even a whole meta-verse such as X The Game or Infinite World Game. A number of default implementations and helper methods will be provided to make it as easy as possible to plug various OAPP's into Our World, H4OME will likely be the quickest and easiest way using its simple drag n drop interface so no programming knowledge will be required.

Our World is a OAPP, hAPP, DAPP & HAPP meaning it can talk to all networks (ONET, H4OME & Ethereum) and other apps. It acts as the bridge and central nexus point between all apps & networks. Additional networks & apps may be added in future...

<a name="oapi--oasis-api-"></a>
### OAPI (OASIS API)

Through the OAPI, an app/website can gain access to the central profile/avatar of a user and grant them additional karma for doing good deeds or making progress within the positive uplifting app/website. Only positive uplifting apps/websites will be granted access to the OAPI and the OASIS System. This will be yet another incentive for developers to start focusing on positive, benevolent uplifting apps/websites/games.

The OAPP API by default hides away complexities such as networking and storage but these can still be accessed by power users.

<a name="onet--oasis-network-"></a>
### ONET (OASIS Network)

The various OAPP's communicate over a private, secure desentralised & distributed network called ONET. A client/node can even choose to share some of their spare processing power to other less powerful clients/nodes in the network, they of course gain additional karma for doing this. This way the crowd is the cloud and acts as a distributed cloud. The network is powered by Holohain. 

<a name="oapp--legacy-apps-websites-"></a>
### OAPP (Legacy Apps/websites)

A OAPP does not need to implement the full UI stack above, it can just use and share the central profile/avatar through the OAPI and will talk directly to the OASIS Engine (where the profile/avatar is stored).

This make it fully backward compatible with existing apps, websites, etc.

<a name="oapp-dapp"></a>
### OAPP/DAPP

An Ethereum DAPP (Distributed App) can also be a OAPP if it implements the OAPI, this means it can talk to both other DAPPs on the Ethereum Blockchain as well as other OAPPs on the ONET Holochain. Our World is the first example of this being a OAPP, DAPP & HAPP.

<a name="oapp-happ"></a>
### OAPP/hAPP

Other Holochain Apps (hAPP) can also be an OAPP and can easily communicate with the ONET/OAPI since Holochain apps can communicate to multiple Holochain networks (ONET is a Holochain network).

<a name="oapp-happ2"></a>
### OAPP/HAPP

An OAPP can also be a HAPP, which means it can plug into both the H4OME & OASIS Systems. This will be the most common use case. This could work by there being some sort of Publish/Export as OAPP option within H4OME or simply a OASIS Engine compatible checkbox within H4OME. This will then ensure the HAPP also implements the OAPI for sharing the central profile Avatar within Our World. If the HAPP also wishes to have a UI within Our World then it will also need to implement the UI stack above, which can be jointly developed by NextGen Software & S7 Foundation (please see the H4OME OASIS implementation Diagram for an example of this).


### Business OAPP

Businesses can also implement OAPP's if they qualify as a benevolent organisation doing good for the people and the planet. They also have a central profile, which also has karma, the more good deeds they do for the people and the planet, the more karma they earn. The higher their karma the bigger and better location of virtual space they will be allocated within Our World. The higher their karma the more premium advertising space they will also be allocated, which will be very limited within Our World since we do not wish to bombard users with adverts as others do. Unlike others, money is not the currency Our World, karma is so they cannot buy their way in. This will encourage organisations to do more to help solve the worlds problems.

### WEB4 OASIS API Architectue Overview

This project is built on the principle of multilayer architecture. Where one of the first Presentation layer's is the REST API Service - [NextGenSoftware.OASIS.API.ONODE.WebAPI](https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK/tree/master/NextGenSoftware.OASIS.API.ONODE.WebAPI) ([http://api.oasisplatform.world/](http://api.oasisplatform.world/)). 

We plan to also add a gRPC and GraphQL endpoint soon. There is also the [WEB 5 STAR ODK](https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK#web5-star-odk) CLI endpoint: [NextGenSoftware.OASIS.STAR.CLI](https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK/tree/master/NextGenSoftware.OASIS.STAR.CLI) that is built on top of the OASIS API and is a Interoperable Metaverse Low Code Generator amongst many more things...
	
Other projects in the solution are providers or tests that plug into it. There is also the [OASIS.API.Core](https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK/tree/master/NextGenSoftware.OASIS.API.Core) project that contains the main OASIS Engine/Architecture and is where the Managers that control the API are, containing all the Business Logic (BLL). 

Providers in various technologies and APIs are integrated, each of them is a library project (modules) that connects (links) with the [NextGenSoftware.OASIS.API.ONODE.WebAPI](https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK/tree/master/NextGenSoftware.OASIS.API.ONODE.WebAPI) project (main Presentation layer). Each of the providers (projects) has a class that implements the [IOASISStorageProvider](https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK/blob/master/NextGenSoftware.OASIS.API.Core/Interfaces/Providers/IOASIStorageProvider.cs) & [IOASISNET](https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK/blob/master/NextGenSoftware.OASIS.API.Core/Interfaces/Providers/IOASISNETProvider.cs) interfaces and which inherits from the abstract class [OASISStorageBase](https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK/blob/master/NextGenSoftware.OASIS.API.Core/OASISStorageProviderBase.cs). 

For more info check out the [WIKI](https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK/wiki/Introduction-to-the-OASIS-API) pages.

**NOTE: This is still a WIP, so the above is likely to evolve and change as we progress...**

<a name="our-world-oasis-will-act-as-the-bridge-for-all--legasy--ipfs--holochain--ethereum--solid--fediverse--mastodon--diaspora--webfinger--activitypub--xmpp---more--"></a>
<a name="bridge"></a>
## Our World/OASIS Will Act As The Bridge For All (Legasy, IPFS, Holochain, Ethereum, SOLID, Fediverse, Mastodon, Diaspora, WebFinger, ActivityPub, XMPP & More!)

As you can see from the architecture diagram, the system will act as the for all platforms and devices due to it being very open and modular by design. In future there will be support for IPFS, Ethereum, SOLID, Fediverse, Mastodon, Diaspora, WebFinger, ActivityPub, XMPP plus many more. This will help users of both legacy apps/games/websites and blockchain slowly migrate to holochain since it will help expose it to them all. The OASIS API will act as a stepping stone as well as help Everything talk to Everything for maximum compatibility.

**Goodbye silos and walled gardens, hello full integration through ONE universal unified interface!**

<a name="implement-your-own-storage-network-renderer-provider"></a>
### Implement Your Own Storage/Network/Renderer Provider

Thanks to the system being very open/modular by design you can easily implement your own Storage/Network/Renderer Provider by simply implementing the [IOASISStorage](#ioasisstorage) / [IOASTNET](#ioasisnet) / IOASIS2DRenderer / IOASIS3DRenderer interfaces respectively. For example you could create a MongoDB, MySQL or SQL Server Storage Provider. This also ensures forward compatibility since if a new storage medium or network protocol comes out in the future you can easily write a new provider for them without having to change any of the existing system. 

The same applies if a new 3D Engine comes out you want to use.

### Switch To A Different Provider In RealTime

The system can even switch to a different Storage/Network Provider in real-time as a fall-over if one storage/network provider goes down for example. It could even use more than one Storage/Network provider since certain providers may be better suited for a given task than another, this way you get the best of both worlds as well as ensure maximum compatibility and uptime.

The same applies for the Renderer Provider, it could use one provider to render 2D and another for 3D, it could even use more than one for for both 2D and/or 3D.

## Fully Integrated Unified Interface

**Our World is much more than just a game or platform. It is also a social network, ecosystem, asset store, operating system, app store, e-commerce & soooooo much more! ;-) It is the XR Gamified Layer of the new interplanetary operating system and the new internet (Web 3.0 - The Spacial Web).  It is the future cyberspace we will all be fully immersed in...**

It combines everything out there into one unified fully integrated interface. You never need to leave the XR/IR interface, you can launch all your apps, surf the net, check your email, make video calls, check your social feeds, play games, use real-time 3D geo-location maps of the world, shop, run your business and do everything you can currently do with existing technology but on a much more evolved fully integrated XR way... If you want to get an idea of what this looks like then watch Ready Player One, the OASIS that features in that is about 40% of what Our World is and we have been designing it long before we had even heard of Ready Player One.

<a name="socialnetwork"></a>
### NextGen Social Network

The social network part of Our World will be a fully de-centralised distributed social network that has your privacy concerns built into the design. You store and own your data on the ONET (powered by Holochain) and choose what you share and to who so it is never stored on any central server where it can be sold to advertisers, etc as is the case with Facebook, Google,etc. 

<a name="oasis-avatar-profile-karma-integration"></a>
#### OASIS Avatar/Profile/Karma Integration

What's more, this is fully integrated into the rest of the system and the OASIS Avatar/Profile/Karma system. So your profile will contain your 3D avatar and you will gain karma if you help people on the network. Of course if you are abusive then you will lose karma so this is a good incentive to behave yourselves and be kind and loving to your fellow earthlings... ;-)

<a name="our-world-oasis-api-social-network-website"></a>
#### Our World/OASIS API/Social Network Website

As well as the smartphone & desktop/console versions of Our World/OASIS, there will also be a traditional website, which will be the social network part of the system where people can view people's profiles/avatars, their karma, chat, find people with similar passions & interests. You can also help other people in need and gain karma, etc. They can also view the various satellite apps/games/websites that are linked and integrated into the OASIS System. Just like the smartphone & console/desktop versions they can also launch the satellite app/game/website from the website.

There will also be a AR & VR version of the social network fully integrated into the smartphone and desktop/console versions of Our World.

Please see the [OASIS API/Karma System](#oasisapi) section for more info.

#### Noomap Integration

This is also of course linked to your Me Holon in Noomap along with all your passions, interests, etc as described earlier.

It will also be deeply integrated into every other aspect of the system as mentioned earlier (shopping, business, games, email, etc).

<a name="deep-integration-into-other-networks-protocols-platforms--such-as-gab--mastodon--diaspora--webfinger--solid--ethereum--fediverse--activitypub--xmpp---more--"></a>
#### Deep Integration Into Other Networks/Protocols/Platforms (Such as Gab, Mastodon, Diaspora, WebFinger, SOLID, Ethereum, Fediverse, ActivityPub, XMPP & More!)

We plan to also deeply integrate into any other aligned open freedom loving networks/platforms/protocols such as Gab, Mastodon, Diaspora, WebFinger, SOLID, Ethereum, Fediverse, ActivityPub, XMPP etc so you can share your profile data between the various networks. You no longer need to have many logins and apps, you just have ONE central portal to do ALL you need to in a very cool evolved XR way...

You can also choose to store your data on any other platform/server such as a SOLID Pod or Matteron Server but either way you will be able to share data between Holochain, SOLID, Etherum, Fediverse (ActivePub) and any other open standard protocol/platform using the OASIS API.

**Our vision is to connect everything to everything through one universal fully integrated interface.**

If only you could see what we see... there is a reason why we are called NextGen Software! ;-)


## Platforms

We will have both a Smartphone App version and a PC/Console version. We are aiming to get this released on as many platform’s as possible including iOS, Android, Windows Phone, iPad, Windows Tablet, Android Tablet, XBOX ONE, PS4 & PC.

Some of the hardware we will be pushing to the limits are below:

**Augmented Reality**
* Magic Leap
* Microsoft HoloLens
* Google Glass
* Google Tango
* Apple ARKit
* Google ARCore
* Others
 
 **Virtual Reality**
* Oculus Rift
* HTC Vive
* Samsung Gear VR
* Samsung Odyssey VR
* PlayStation VR
* Others
 
**Emotional Feedback**
* NeuroSky/MyndPlay
* Others
 
**Motion Detection/Voice Recognition/Eye Tracking**
* Kinect
* Leap Motion
* Others

**Haptic Feedback**
* Hapto VR 
* Others

If you check out the demos of the above, you will start to get an idea of the apps & games we are building. However, of course we are pushing these to the next level by building the next generation apps & games for today. The game is much bigger than just a game, it is more like a massive educational platform, with a LOT more revolutionary ideas, which at this time we cannot make public.

<a name="pc-console-version"></a>
#### PC/Console Version

Our World will have continuous expansions, add-ons and
 sub-games added to keep players immersed and wanting more and more. Our World is revolutionary and contains many elements never done before and so will not have any competition in the new genres it will be creating…

#### Smartphone Version

The smartphone version is a free app with in-app purchases. This is why Our World will be free to download and have many in-app purchases not only for items you can use but also for expansion packs and sub-games. All of which will leave the player wanting more and more…

## NextGen Hardware

Current devices such as phones, tablets, laptops, etc emit harmful EMF (Electro Magnetic Field) radiation. This includes Wi Fi and 3G/4G/5G. The faster and more powerful they become the more dangerous they are to us. We are electromagnetic beings and so we are sensitive to this radiation. 

We plan to tackle this with our nextgen devices, which not only shield you from these harmful effects but actually heal you. They will also never need charging using the latest nextgen technology (Torus Energy & Zero Point Energy). They will also have nextgen performance and usability and be fully integrated with our nextgen software.

We will provide fully integrated software/firmware/hardware solutions that are free of any spyware/backdoors/surveillance as sadly is the case today with most of the devices out there. We have already begun talking to various providers of Open Source hardware/operating systems for smartphone devices but this is something we will be moving onto at a later date, maybe by around 2021...

## Our World Overview

### Introduction

Imagine playing a game more fun and immersive than Pokémon Go, Minecraft, World of Warcraft and Second Life combined? A game that is not only a lot of fun to play but also teaches you how to look after your wellbeing as well as looking after our beautiful planet. A game that changes the way we think and interact with each other and the world so together we can create a better world for all of us. One where we can come together and help each other for the greater good of all.

Imagine a world where there are no more wars, poverty or suffering.

Imagine a world where there is only peace, love & unity where we all co-exist living as one human race in harmony with each other and our beautiful planet.

This does not just have to be a dream; together we can create this world…

Let us introduce you to Our World, the game that will change the world. As well as helping to make the world a better place, this game will be pushing the boundaries of what is currently possible with technology. It will feature augmented reality, virtual reality, motion detection, voice recognition and real-time emotional feedback. It will use technology in ways that has not been done before and in areas where it has been done, it will innovate and take it to the next level...

The software industry has a morale & social responsibility to use technology to help create a better world rather than lead to further decline. It has the power to transform lives through engaging people with innovative products that help them to grow and develop. Recent popular examples include health apps, mindfulness apps and mind training games.

We wish to take this to the next level and help make the world a better place by using technology for good, by bringing people together and to support, guide and educate everyone on how we can all live happier, fulfilling lives and at the same time how we can help save our planet.

We will do this by creating a suite of nextgen apps & games using the latest cutting-edge technology such as Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Real-time emotional feedback, face/voice recognition, motion detection and so much more.

**Our World is an exciting immersive next generation 3D XR/IR (Infinite Reality) educational game/platform/social network/ecosystem teaching people on how to look after themselves, each other and the planet using the latest cutting-edge technology. It teaches people the importance of real-life face to face connections with human beings and encourages them to get out into nature using Augmented Reality similar to Pokémon Go but on a much more evolved scale. This is our flagship product and is our top priority due to the massive positive impact it will make upon the world...**

### XR/IR Gamification Layer Of The New Interplanetary Operating System & The New Internet (Web 3.0)
 
**It is the XR/IR Gamification layer of the new interplanetary operating system & the new internet (Web 3.0), which is being built by the elite technical wizards stationed around the world. This will one day replace the current tech giants such as Google, FaceBook, etc and act as the technical layer of the New Earth, which is birthing now.  Unlike the current tech giants who's only aim is to ruthlessly maximize profits at the expense of people and the planet (as well as spying, exploitation, censorship & social engineering), our technology is based on true love & unity consciousness where money and profits are not our aim or intention, our aim and intention is to heal the entire planet & human race so we can all live in harmony with each other.  It is a 5th dimensional and ascension training platform, teaching people vital life lessons as well as acting as a real-time simulation of the real world.**

As well as helping to make the world a better place, this game will be pushing the boundaries of what is currently possible with technology. It will feature augmented reality, virtual reality, motion detection, voice recognition and real-time emotional feedback. It will use technology in ways that has not been done before and in areas where it has been done, it will innovate and take it to the next level...

<a name="open-world-new-ecosystm-asset-store-internet-operating-system-social-network"></a>
### Open World/New Ecosystm/Asset Store/Internet/Operating System/Social Network

It is much more than just a free open world game where you can build and create anything you can imagine and at the same time be immersed in an epic storyline. it is an entirely new ecosystem/asset store/internet/Operating System/social network, it is the future way we will be interacting with each other and the world through the use of technology. Smaller satellite apps/game will plug into it and share your central profile/avatar where you gain karma for doing good deeds such as helping your local communities, etc and lose karma for being selfish and not helping others since it mirrors the real world where you have free will. There is nothing else out there like this, nothing even comes close, this will change everything... There is a reason we are called NextGen Software! ;-)

The game teaches people true unity consciousness where everyone benefits if people put their differences aside and work together. Our World is also an ecosystem and a virtual e-commerce platform and so, so, so much more, it will create a whole new genre and blaze a new path for others to try and follow…

Our World has now merged with our NextGen Social Network project, which was always planned to be the prequel to Our World, so it made sense to simply merge them together.

### Infinite Alternate Reality Game (IARG)

Our World is also a Infinite Alternate Reality Game where the line between virtual and reality blurs into one.

### Our World Integrates The Commons Engine & Mutual Crypto Currency

Our World will fully integrate the Commons Engine & Mutual Crypto Currency to educate the world in a fun gamified way how society can work much fairer and more effectively doing away with the current unfair fiat system that is controlled by the greedy banks, corportations & governments.

### Synergy Engine

Our World implements the Synergy Engine helping to solve the world’s problems by matching solutions to problems. It also teaches the co-creation wheel and a new holistic approach to living and technology to help co-create a better world. 

Our World implements the Synergy Engine helping to solve the world’s problems by matching solutions to problems. It also teaches the co-creation wheel and a new holistic approach to living and technology to help co-create a better world. 

### Resource Based Economy

Our World teaches people the benefits of a <a href="https://www.thevenusproject.com/resource-based-economy/">Resource Based Economy</a> (coined by Jacque Fresco, the founder of <a href="https://www.thevenusproject.com/">The Venus Project</a>) where the world's resources are freely available to everyone and people exchange products and services without the need for money. For this to be achieved all resources must be declared as the common heritage of all Earth’s inhabitants. Equipped with the latest scientific and technological marvels mankind could reach extremely high productivity levels and create abundance of resources. This also prevents money being hoarded through greed and corruption and can no longer be used to control & divide people. A Resource Based Economy is actually fully integrated into Our World.

### First AAA MMO Game To Run On Holochain

Our World is built on top of the de-centralised, distributed nextgen internet known as Holochain.

Our World will be the first AAA MMO game and 2D/3D Social Network to run on HoloChain and the Blockchain. It will also be the first to integrate a social network with a MMO game/platform as well as all of these technologies and devices together. As with the rest of the game, it will be leading the way in what can be done with this NextGen Technology for the benefit and upliftment of humanity. 

Read more here:

https://www.ourworldthegame.com/single-post/2019/02/22/Why-Our-World-Is-Powered-By-Holochain 

We will soon be launching our ICO to sell our OASIS Coin, more news on this soon...

### Smartphone Version

The smartphone version will be a geolocation game featuring Augmented Reality similar to Pokemon Go but on a much more evolved scale (yes, we were designing this long before Pokemon Go came out!).

### Console Version

The console/desktop version will be similar to a Sandbox and MMORPG (Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game) but
 will be nothing like any other games such as World Of WarCraft & MineCraft. It will in fact define its own genre setting the new bar for others to follow, this truly has never been done before and will take the world by storm! The one thing it will share with them is that it will be a massive open world that billions of players can explore and build together... 

Both versions will share the same online world/multiverse where users logged in through the smartphone versions will be able to interact with the console/desktop versions in real-time within a massive scale persistent Multiverse.

### Engrossing Storyline

You can run around an open world completing quests in whatever order you choose but it will also contain an engrossing storyline, which will change depending on what choices both you and the collective take as a whole. The story is about the final epic battle for Earth between the forces of darkness and the light that has been raging across Galaxies & Universes for eons. You will fight demons, zombies, monsters, killer robots controlled by a dark evil AI and more. The main difference to other games is that you will not fight fellow humans (although the dark AI is trying to manipulate mankind in to doing just that), instead you will unite together against the new common enemy that is threatening the very existence of mankind and the planet. You will be free to build your own homes, communities, base defences, vehicles & ships (or purchase or win) either using traditional means, nextgen technology or even magic. The same goes for combat, you can choose to use pure strength, skill and melee, technology or magic. You can be whoever you want to be. You can even choose not to fight and instead focus on supporting the economy, farming, healing, R&D, construction, leadership, etc. The choice is yours...

As you proceed through the game you will discover that this dark evil AI has taken over the minds of many humans who are in positions of power & influence across the globe such as Governments, banking, corporations, educational institutions, pharmaceutical & the military and is using them as puppets for its evil plans for world domination. This secret society is known as The Dark Order. The dark AI (also known as The Beast) is manipulating humanity to create technology and robotic bodies for it to control to form its army of machines. It is also trying to get every human implanted with a chip so it can track and control them, this is known as the Mark Of The Beast. It is also trying to manipulate them to open a portal to other dimensions to bring forth its dark army in the final phase of its plan. It plans to exterminate 90% of the population and enslave the rest. Your mission along with the rest of mankind is to stop this before it is too late...

### OASIS Asset Store

Objects created (vehicles, building, etc) can be shared and even sold on the OASIS Asset Store. Objects created on other popular platforms such as Google Blocks and Microsoft's 3D Creator can also be imported and used in Our World.

### Virtual E-commerce

As well as smaller apps/games being allowed to plug into Our World either sharing just the central avatar/profile (data) or full UI integration, content creators/businesses can also create shops (where people can purchase real items in VR that are then delivered to your door so in effect is virtual e-commerce), buildings or even entire zones/lands/worlds. They can rent virtual spaces within the game. Please contact us on ourworld@nextgensoftware.co.uk if you wish to receive special early adopter discounts...

<a name="we-accept-karma--your-money-is-no-good-here-"></a>
### We Accept Karma, Your Money Is No Good Here!

Businesses can also sponsor or advertise in the game but unlike traditional models, money does not buy you the best spots, the companies collective karma does. The greener & the more they do good for the world including giving to charities, looking after their employees, the environment, etc the more karma they get. Advertising spots will be limited since we do not wish to bombard users with adverts so this will be an incentive for companies worldwide to improve and start focusing on what is important, and that's people and the environment, not money. As may be clear by now, the focus and goals of Our World is to create a better world, not to make as much money as possible. But we of course will still make more than enough (billions) to continue to expand & grow, the rest will go to good causes and charities such as our sister company Yoga4Autism.

### Our World Is Only The Beginning...

Our World is only the beginning... once we have learnt to resolve our problems and live in peace and harmony with each other and the planet then we will be ready to reach out and explore other worlds within our Universe and beyond...

**We cannot try to run from our problems and escape to other worlds (virtual or real), we need to stay and heal Our World first...
Once we have done that then we can transform Our World into the OASIS, a paradise on Earth...**

**Our World is just the first world of an infinite number of worlds, stars, systems, galaxies & universes to explore...**

**This multiverse is called The OASIS, which can only be reached through the OASIS we are co-creating on Our World.**

The OASIS will only be open to us once we have resolved our issues here, humanity must prove they are worthy to join the Galactic Societies waiting for us out there... How can we meet, interact and get on with other races out there when we cannot even get on with each other here?

It is time to stop running from our problems and face them united together...

<a name="the-tech-industry-have-a-morale---social-responsibility"></a>
### The Tech Industry Have A Morale & Social Responsibility

The software industry has the power to transform lives through engaging people with innovative products that help them to grow and develop.  Recent popular examples include health apps, mindfulness apps and mind training games.

We wish to take this to the next level and help make the world a better place by using technology for good, by bringing people together and to support, guide and educate everyone on how we can all live happier, fulfilling lives and at the same time how we can help save our planet.

People learn at a young age how to act and behave and this shapes the future generations and the world they will create. Due to the majority of games these days involving violence, sex, gambling, drugs & crime, this is conditioning the youth of today to the sort of world they will create tomorrow.

With the advent of Virtual Reality now making these violent games even more immersive and realistic where the boundaries between games and reality is shrinking by the day, it is imperative we take some social and moral responsibility and start using technology to help create a better world by improving people's life's as well as respecting the environment and planet that sustains us.

Kids today are playing very violent games such as Call Of Duty which are used as brainwashing techniques to desensitise us to violence and also act as a training and recruitment tool for the military (which they have now admitted). The same goes for flight simulators being used to train and recruit drone pilots.

We hope you will agree this is totally unacceptable and is part of why there is so much war, violence, etc in today’s world. It is time we start using technology to teach people the correct life lessons. Our World acts as a simulation for the real world and teaches them how to create a better world in the simulation and then shows how they can then implement these important lessons in real life. Read more on our previous blog post about violence in video games:

https://www.ourworldthegame.com/single-post/2018/03/14/Good-they-are-finally-start-to-take-the-violence-in-video-games-seriously 

Gambling is being forced onto kids more and more in the form of loot boxes where real money is asked for to receive a random prize and now it’s got so bad that money is actually needed to progress within the game. Everything seems to be geared around how much people can be exploited and how much money can be sucked out of them, this is even more wrong for kids. Read more on our previous post about this below:

https://www.ourworldthegame.com/single-post/2017/11/29/Do-you-think-its-right-kids-are-gambling-in-games 

We wish to reach the kids who are glued to their phones and consoles and never go outside, this game will encourage them to get out into parks and interact with people in fun creative ways face to face instead of through their phones.

### Teach Kids The Right Life Lessons

The game will also be teaching people especially kids important vital life lessons and show how they can then implement them in the real world. Part of the way this will be done is by merging the real world with Our World using the latest cutting-edge technology such as Augmented Reality. We wish to get kids and everyone else off their devices and back into nature and to start having real face to face interactions again. We wish to use technology for the upliftment and benefit of humanity and the planet and not just as an escape mechanism or a way to exploit people by selling their data to the highest bidder.

<a name="remember-how-powerful-you-are-"></a>
### Remember How Powerful YOU Are!

Our World reminds people how powerful they are and empowers them to be the person they have always wanted to be, to live their life to their FULL potential without any limitations. Everyone has a gift for the world and with Our World we can help them find it. We want to empower people to take responsibility for our beautiful planet, which is currently in crisis and so needs EVERYONE to help make a difference. The entire world is the Our World team, we want everyone to get involved
 so they can feel they are part of something greater than themselves and at the same time ensure there is a future for our kids and grandkids.

### Bringing People Together

We wish to bring people together, build online communities, encourage people to reach out and help strangers for the greater good of all. To encourage people to come and work together and to show how everyone benefits if they put their differences aside and start all rowing together. It will model the real world and also act as a simulation and training environment for how to make the real world a better place.

### We are Building The Evolved Benevolent Version Of The OASIS

We are building the evolved benevolent version of the OASIS featured in the popular Ready Player One novel and Spielberg film. The OASIS is only about 40% of what Our World is to give you an idea of the sheer size and magnitude of this project! It is aimed at saving the world rather than leading to its destruction due to the neglect it faced when everyone escaped into the OASIS. Ready Player One has proven so popular that Spielberg & Warner Brothers have now released the blockbuster film, which we hope will help promote Our World further. It is about someone with Autism who creates a revolutionary 3D VR Platform which takes the world by storm because it is so far ahead of everything else out there. The creator of the 3D VR platform known as the OASIS grew up in the 80's, is obsessed with the 80's and had guitar lessons as a kid, which also describes our founder David Ellams.

<a name="ascension-god-training---mirror-of-reality-technology"></a>
### Ascension/God Training & Mirror Of Reality Technology

These are the Last Days of Mortal Man through this God Training Programme.

The self-reflective immersive XR game that has been created as ascension technology to help the user to discover their higher self through learning important lessons in how to be, think and feel as a human being. Through “karma” each individual can build themselves to be a better version of themselves that on a sub conscious level will teach them how this can be applied in the real world. The game truly is a mirror for reality. 

Some important points about its potential capabilities and why it could be truly unique:

**Bio Scan technology**- through mapping of brain waves, it can suggest activities and exercises that correlate to the analysis it receives teaching the user to be more mindful about health and wellbeing.

**Life cycle** - There will be time constraints on how long each player can be in Our World for. The vital energy will correlate with reality meaning they will not be burn themselves out locked in the game. Teaching the individual once again the important lessons of having a balanced lifestyle. The character, like the player needs to be looked after.

**Virtual Advertising** - Companies can use the advertising and be awarded prime spots based on their own karma value meaning that those that act more responsibly and consciously in real life (such as giving to charity, being green, looking after their employees, etc) will have access to the most prime spots, as opposed to those who pay the most.

**Time Bending Treasures** - Messages and gifts can be buried as Easter eggs for others to collect at later dates bending the nature of time. 

<a name="7-years-of-planning---r-d"></a>
### 7 Years Of Planning & R&D

We actually started researching, planning & designing this over seven years (we have also been busy networking, building partnerships, etc) ago but we could not yet afford the large amount of money it would take to create this. On top of this, the technology did not yet exist to create the vision, but this is now changing. When Pokémon Go was released featuring more primitive versions of some of the technology featured in Our World, we realised we really need to get this game into production.

### Early Prototype

We need your investment/help so we can continue development of the cutting-edge prototype we have been working on for the last couple of years. This is the first Unity game to be powered by the revolutionary decentralised distributed network called Holochain. This means that your profile and data is stored locally on your device giving you back control of your own data. See screenshots here:

https://www.ourworldthegame.com/single-post/2018/08/14/First-look-at-our-Smartphone-Prototype

Check out the latest progress made with the protoype below:

https://www.ourworldthegame.com/single-post/2019/08/03/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-Goes-Open-Source- 

We can then demo this to interested parties so we can get more investment to get the first version of this game released. This game will have continuous development with frequent upgrades and add-ons. It is so vast, that the development roadmap is never ending.

### We Are What You Have All Been Waiting For...

http://www.ccsinsight.com/press/company-news/2251-augmented-and-virtual-reality-devices-to-become-a-4-billion-plus-business-in-three-years 

 An exert from the above article states:

“VR (virtual reality) and AR (augmented reality) are exciting – Google Glass coming and going, Facebook’s $2 billion for Oculus, Google’s $542 million into Magic Leap, not to mention Microsoft’s delightful HoloLens. There are amazing early stage platforms and apps, but VR/AR in 2015 feels a bit like the smartphone market before the iPhone. We’re waiting for someone to say “One more thing…” in a way that has everyone thinking “so that’s where the market’s going!”

Well, we are what everyone has been waiting for, to take this technology to the next level, hence our name!

Pokémon Go has already started to lose users as we predicted due to not being nowhere near immersive enough so to keep users engaged in the game. Our World is set to be one of the most immersive games ever made so it will not suffer from this problem.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37176782 
 
 
### Large Social Media Following

With over 5628 likes on our Facebook page ( http://www.facebook.com/ourworldthegame ), which is growing daily, this very important project is being very well received and we constantly receive glowing feedback of how much of a wonderful good idea this is, one that is needed more than ever in today’s world!

We are currently building the smartphone prototype and hope to have this done by 2020 Q2. We are also looking for any other developers, designers, 3D modellers and anyone else who wish to get involved so please get in touch if this is YOU...

### UN Contacts

### The NextGen Office

Our NextGen Offices that we plan to build one day will be deeply integrated with nature so streams, trees, etc will be inside a bit like <a href="https://www.centerparcs.com">Center Parcs</a> in UK. They will also be built to Sacred Geometry specifications so they are actually healing to work inside one. They will also contain healing crystals & orgonite so it actually heals and energizes you while you work...  They are also similar to the ones the <a href="https://www.thevenusproject.com">Venus Project</a> intend to build. Read more below:

### Golden Investment Opportunity

According to the latest research the VR/AR Market is set for VERY explosive growth with estimates of $674bn by 2025. The mobile app industry has been growing exponentially for a number of years now and is set to continue to accelerate. The mobile app market was valued last year at over 27 billion dollars and is set to reach 77 billion this year.

So, make sure you get in on the ground floor of the next Apple, which will be the GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY of a lifetime!

## The Power Of Autism

This game, website and promotional videos were all designed and created by our founder and Managing Director David Ellams BSc(Hons) who was given the labels of Aspergers (High Functioning Autism), Dyspraxia & Dyslexia. But he did not let these labels define him and has worked very hard to get where he is today. A lot of this was down to the yoga, meditation & mindfulness that helped transform his life in the most amazing way and helped managed the symptoms of autism as well as allowing him to harness his natural gifts in IT. 

This is why he created <a href="http://www.yoga4autism.com">Yoga4Autism</a> to help teach other people the power of yoga thus enabling them to live happy fulfilling life's to their FULL potential without any limitations as he now enjoys. He then wishes to give them all FREE training & jobs to help create a better world and to show the world what people with autism and so-called "disabilities" can REALLY do...

## Better Than A Fornite Clone! ;-)

There was recently a blog post from Holochain talking about how the community wanted to make a Fortnite clone using Holochain. But we say why do you want to make a clone of yet another game promotting and gloryifing violence? Wouldn't you rather co-create a game that helps make the world a better place and ensures a future for the next generation by teaching them the right life lessons?

Read more on one of our recent blog posts: </br>
https://www.ourworldthegame.com/single-post/2019/02/22/Why-Our-World-Is-Powered-By-Holochain


## HoloNET

The world's first .NET & Unity client for [Holochain](http://holochain.org).

This library will allow you to connect any .NET or Unity client to Holochain and enjoy the power of a fully de-centralised distributed P2P multi-network agent-centric architecture.

This will help massively turbo charge the holochain ecosystem by opening it up to the massive .NET and Unity communities and open up many more possibilities of the things that can be built on top of Holochain. You can build almost anything you can imagine with .NET and/or Unity from websites, desktop apps, smartphone apps, services, AAA Games and lots more! They can target every device and platform out there from XBox, PS4, Wii, PC, Linux, Mac, iOS, Android, Windows Phone, iPad, Tablets, SmartTV, VR/AR/XR, MagicLeap, etc

**We are a BIG fan of Holochain and are very passionate about it and see a BIG future for it! We feel this is the gateway to taking Holochain mainstream! ;-)**

There are two versions of HoloNET:

[NextGenSoftware.Holochain.HoloNET.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NextGenSoftware.Holochain.HoloNET.Client) - Lightweight version that does not come with the holochain binaries (hc.exe and holochain.exe).

[NextGenSoftware.Holochain.HoloNET.Client.Embedded](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NextGenSoftware.Holochain.HoloNET.Client.Embedded) - This version comes with the holochain binaries (hc.exe and holochain.exe) integrated.

You can also find the Test Harness here:

[NextGenSoftware.Holochain.HoloNET.Client.TestHarness](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NextGenSoftware.Holochain.HoloNET.Client.TestHarness)

Read more on how to use the [Test Harness here](https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/holochain-client-csharp/tree/main/NextGenSoftware.Holochain.HoloNET.Client.TestHarness).

Read the [full documentaion here](https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/holochain-client-csharp).

## HoloUnity

Check out the [full documentation here](https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/holochain-client-csharp#holounity), which shows how to use HoloNET in Unity.
	
## HoloOASIS

`HoloOASIS` uses the [HoloNETClient](#holonet) to implement a Storage Provider ([IOASISStorage](https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK#ioasisstorage)) for the OASIS System. It will soon also implement a Network Provider ([IOASISNET](https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK#ioasisnet))
 for the OASIS System that will leverage Holochain to create it's own private de-centralised distributed network called `ONET` (as seen on the [OASIS Architecture Diagram](#the-oasis-architecture)).

This is a good example to see how to use [HoloNETClient](#holonet) in a real world game/platform (OASIS/Our World).

### Using HoloOASIS

You start by instantiating a new HoloOASIS class.

````c#
HoloOASIS _holoOASIS = new HoloOASIS("ws://localhost:8888");
````

You pass into the constructor the URI to the Holochain conductor.

Next, wire up the events:

````c#
_holoOASIS.HoloNETClient.OnConnected += HoloNETClient_OnConnected;
_holoOASIS.OnInitialized += _holoOASIS_OnInitialized;
_holoOASIS.OnAvatarLoaded += _holoOASIS_OnAvatarLoaded;
_holoOASIS.OnAvatarSaved += _holoOASIS_OnAvatarSaved;
_holoOASIS.OnHoloOASISError += _holoOASIS_OnHoloOASISError;
````

Once HoloOASIS has finished initializing after the `OnInitialzed` event has fired you can create a new Avatar by creating a new Avatar object and populating it with the required properties.

You can also add karma by calling the `AddKarma` method on the `Profile` object.

Finally you call the `SaveProfileAsync` method passing in the `Profile` object to save the profile to your local chain on Holochain.

````c#
private static void _holoOASIS_OnInitialized(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
            Console.WriteLine("Initialized.");
            Console.WriteLine("Saving Avatar...");

            _savedAvatar = new Avatar { Username = "dellams", Email = "david@nextgensoftware.co.uk", Password = "1234", FirstName = "David", LastName = "Ellams", DOB = "11/04/1980", Id = Guid.NewGuid(), Title = "Mr", PlayerAddress = "blahahahaha" };
            _savedAvatar.AddKarma(999);

            _holoOASIS.SaveAvatarsync(_savedAvatar);
}
````

To load the `Avatar` object back from your local chain on Holochain you simply call the `LoadAvatarAsync` method passing in the desired Avatar's Holochain hash, which is returned as a param in the `OnAvatarSaved` event handler.

````c#
private static void _holoOASIS_OnPlayerProfileSaved(object sender, ProfileSavedEventArgs e)
{
            Console.WriteLine("Avatar Saved.");
            Console.WriteLine("Avatar Entry Hash: " + e.Avatar.HcAddressHash);
            Console.WriteLine("Loading Avatar...");
            //_savedAvatar.Id = new Guid(e.ProfileEntryHash);
            _holoOASIS.LoadAvatarAsync(e.Avatar.HcAddressHash);
}
````

**More to come soon...**
	
## OASIS API Core

This is where the main OASIS API is located and contains all of the interfaces that the various providers implement along with the base objects & managers to power the OASIS API.

It is located in the `NextGenSoftware.OASIS.API.Core` project.

#### Using The OASIS API Core

The API is constantly evolving so keeping the documentation in sync with the code is hard so please bare with us, in the meantime please check the codebase directly for latest changes. Thank you.

You can now use the OASIS API either through the [REST API](https://api.oasisplatform.world) or through the [fully integrated native endpoint](https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK/releases).

You can alternatively use the various OASIS API Managers contained in the [OASIS.API.Core](https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK/tree/master/NextGenSoftware.OASIS.API.Core) project directly.

You start by instantiating the `AvatarManager` class:

````c#
// Inject in the HoloOASIS Storage Provider (this could be moved to a config file later so the 
// providers can be swapped without having to re-compile. This work has now been completed with the OASISDNA.json file. 
AvatarManager = new AvatarManager(new HoloOASIS("ws://localhost:8888"));
````

The `AvatarManager` takes one param for the constructor of type [IOASISStorage](#ioasisstorage). This is where you inject in a Provider that implements the [IOASISStorage](#ioasisstorage) interface. 

````c#
public AvatarManager(IOASISStorage
 OASISStorageProvider)
{
            this.OASISStorageProvider = OASISStorageProvider;
            this.OASISStorageProvider.OnStorageProviderError += OASISStorageProvider_OnStorageProviderError;
}
````

Part of the [IOASISStorage](#ioasisstorage) interface has an event called OnStorageProviderError, which the provider fires to send errors back to the `AvatarManager`.

Once the `AvatarManager` has been instantiated. you can load the users Avatar using the `LoadAvatarAsync` method:

````c#
OASISResult<IAvatar> avatarResult = await AvatarManager.LoadAvatarAsync(username, password);

if (!avatarResult.IsError && avatarResult.Result != null)
{
	//TODO: Bind avatar info to Unity Avatar UI here.
}
````

### Interfaces

The OASIS API currently has the following interfaces defined:

|Interface|Description  |
|--|--|
|[IOASISStorage](#ioasisstorage)  | This is what a Storage Provider implements so the OASIS API can read & write the users profile/avatar to the storage medium/network. Check out the [full list](https://github.com/NextGenSoftwareUK/Our-World-OASIS-API-HoloNET-HoloUnity-And-.NET-HDK#protocols-platforms-networks-supported--providers-) of providers that have implemented this interface.  |
|[IOASISNET](#ioasisnet)| This is what a Network Provider implements so the OASIS API can share the users profile/avatar as well as fine Holons and players near them. 

**NOTE: The interfaces are evolving all the time so it is hard to keep the documentation up to date, so best to check in the codebase itself...  Additional interfaces will also be added such as the IOASISRenderer interface. There are now many more interfaces that need documenting but as we said best to check the codebase directly...**

#### IOASISStorage  

This is what a Storage Provider implements so the OASIS API can read & write the users profile/avatar to the storage medium/network.

````c#

| Item|Description  |
|--|--|
| LoadAvatarAsync | Loads the users profile/avatar. This has 3 overloads, one takes a providerKey (a unique key that the provider can use to identify a avatar, [HoloOASIS](#holooasis) uses the address hash for this), one takes a username & password and the final one takes a Guid for the avatarID, which is a unique id for the avatar irrespective of which provider is providing it.  |
| SaveAvatarAsync | Saves the users profile/avatar. 
| AddKarmaToAvatarAsync | Add karma to the users profile/avatar.
| RemoveKarmaFromAvatarAsync | Remove karma from the users profile/avatar.
| StorageProviderError | An event the provider fires when an error occurs that the `AvatarManager` can then handle.

#### IOASISNET

This is what a Network Provider implements so the OASIS API can share the users profile/avatar as well as find Holon's and players near them. 

````c#
namespace NextGenSoftware.OASIS.API.Core
{
    // This interface provides methods to discover and interact with other nodes/peers on the distributed/decentralised network (ONET)
    // This will involve peer to peer communication.
    public interface IOASISNET
    {
        List<IPlayer> GetPlayersNearMe();
        List<IHolon> GetHolonsNearMe(HolonType Type);
    }
}
````

| Item | Description  |
|--|--|
| GetPlayersNearMe  | Gets a list of players near the user's current location.  |
| GetHolonsNearMe | Get a list of holon's near the user's current location.

## Road Map

**Version 1 - Smartphone Platform - The AR version** - Map of present day - In correlation with Time - **IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT**. We hope to have an early prototype of this around 2020 Q1/Q2 with more evolved prototypes being released throughout the year. Depending on how many resources/devs we can attract we hope to have a first altha release by 2021, possibly 2022.

**Version 2 - Desktop/Console Platforms - The VR Version** - Game version that starts in Past with a true history of Earth. Not Time Correlated. We hope work on this can begin by 2020 (if additional funds/resources can be secured by then) and will be done
 in parallel with the Smartphone version. Remember these are not seperate products, and fully integrate with each other where players share the same immersive persistent real-time open world.

**Version 3 - The XR/IR Version (The OASIS)** - The XR version that becomes the immersive, self reflective reality that combines both aspects of console and smartphone versions. We hope we will secure MASSIVE funds by 2021/2022 latest so this can begin dev around that time, this is Ready Player One OASIS time with life like graphics and things you can only begin to imagine right now! ;-)

## Next Steps

Not in priority order:

* Add HTTP support to HoloNET.
* Implement IOASISNET interface for HoloOASIS Provider.
* Add built-in HC Conductor to HoloNET so it can fire up it's own conductor without needing to do this manually.
* Add a ZomeProxyGenerator tool so it can auto-generate a C# Zome Proxy that wraps around HoloNET calls (the code would be similar to what is in HoloOASIS)
* Continue with Unity integration and development of HoloUnity, which will then also be gifted forward to the wonderful holochain community... :)
* Refactor HoloNET to split out the websocket JSON RPC 2.0 implementation from the holochain specific logic so the websocket JSON RPC code can be re-used with the OASIS API websocket implementation coming soon...
* Implement OASIS API Websocket JSON RPC 2.0 implementation.
* Implement OASIS API Websocket HTTP implementation.
* Implement OASIS API HTTP Restful WebAPI implementation.
* Finish implementing avatar screen in Unity.
* Place avatar on 3D map using users current location (geolocation) from their device GPS.
* Implement Mapping/Routing API for 3D Map in Unity.
* Implement Places Of Interest (Holons) on 3D Map.
* Implement ARC Membrane API.
* Implement Unity Nlogger.
* Implement animated cars, planes, water, etc on 3D Map.
* Fix bug so when zooming out on 3D Map it shows the full globe instead of going white.
* Implement demo satellite apps/games/websites to show how OASIS API works.
* Implement OASIS API in a number of real apps/games/websites that are waiting and ready...
* Implement Quests on 3D Map (geolocation).
* Implement AR Mode in parks, etc.
* Implement Synergy Engine matching solution providers to requesters.
* Port Noomap to Unity.
* Plus LOTS & LOTS more to come! ;-)

## HoloSource Licence

This repo uses a new type of Open Source where more control is needed over the codebase to make sure things do not go off on a tangent that is not beneficial to the original intention and vision of this very important critical project to help save the world and make it a better place for all. Too much is at stake to stop this falling into the wrong hands so to speak! ;-)

This means permission will need to be requested for any forks, etc 

The whole point of opening up this codebase to the public is we wish to empower the whole world to take responsibility for our beautiful planet and this is why the whole world is the
 Our World team. It will be one of the biggest most ambitious projects the world has ever seen and this is why it needs to be open to all...

**Ready to do your part? ;-)**

**Although the rest of this repo is HoloSourced in that you need to be granted permission to fork and use it, HoloNET is totally free and Open Sourced to be used anyway you wish. If you find it helpful, we would REALLY appreciate a donation to our crowd funding page, because this is our full-time job and so have no other income and will help keep us alive so we can continue to improve it for you all, thank you! :)**
