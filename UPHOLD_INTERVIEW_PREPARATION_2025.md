## Part 4: Interview Talking Points

### Opening Statement (30 seconds)

> "I've built production-ready infrastructure for tokenizing real-world assets with automatic revenue distribution - think fractional real estate where monthly rent flows to token holders in 30 seconds. I've already proven this works with 432 NFTs earning passive income from an API business. With Uphold's 10 million users and 'Anything-to-Anything' vision, we could launch RWA products in 6 months instead of 2 years, capturing the $16 trillion tokenization opportunity. I'm particularly excited about bringing sports, entertainment, and music assets to Uphold, building innovative debit card rewards, and leading UK Web3 policy advocacy."

### Key Messages

**1. Speed to Market**
- "I've built the infrastructure - x402 revenue distribution, OASIS multi-chain platform, universal asset tokens. Uphold could launch first RWA products in 90 days, not 2 years."

**2. Production-Ready**
- "This isn't theoretical - I have 432 NFTs earning real revenue today. The x402 system is production-ready, fully documented, and proven to work."

**3. Strategic Alignment**
- "Uphold's 'Anything-to-Anything' brand is perfect for RWAs. You already have 10 million users who trust you. The infrastructure I've built fills the gap between where you are and where you need to be."

**4. UK Opportunity**
- "UK is at an inflection point - FCA is open to innovation, government is crypto-friendly, but no one is leading consumer RWA policy. Uphold could be first."

### Questions to Ask Them

**Strategic:**
1. "How does the board think about Web3 and tokenization? Is RWA a top-3 priority for 2025?"
2. "What's Uphold's biggest competitive threat over the next 3 years?"
3. "If you could add one new asset class tomorrow, what would it be?"

**Technical:**
4. "What are your biggest technical pain points today? How do you currently evaluate and integrate new blockchains?"
5. "What's your approach to blockchain infrastructure - build, buy, or partner?"

**Product:**
6. "What do customers ask for most that you don't offer yet?"
7. "How do you think about launching new products - big bet or MVP?"

**Culture:**
8. "How does product/engineering collaborate here? What does successful innovation look like?"
