# 💰 OASIS Oracle - Seed Round Pitch Outline

---

## **THE ASK**

**Raising: $5M Seed Round**  
**Pre-Money Valuation: $20M**  
**Dilution: 20%**

## **THE PROBLEM ($100-150B)**

Financial institutions lock up **$100-150 billion** in unnecessary collateral because they don't know **"who owns what, when"** in real-time across 20+ blockchains and legacy systems.

**Result:**
- Banks over-collateralize by 50-100%
- $150B+ capital trapped unnecessarily
- 12-24 hour settlement delays
- Manual reconciliation errors
- Margin call delays cost billions

|--------|--------------|---------------|
| **Runway** | 15 months | 18 months |
| **Team Size** | 7 people | 13 people |
| **Sales Reps** | 1 | 3 |

| **Series A Valuation** | $50M | $150M |
| **Investor Return (3yr)** | 2.5x | 6x |

---

## **WHY $5M IS BETTER THAN $3M**

**With $3M:** We can get to $10M ARR. We'll survive. But it's tight.

**With $5M:** We get to $30M ARR comfortably. Here's why:

1. **3 sales reps vs 1**
   - Banks have 12-month sales cycles
   - 1 rep = pursue 3 banks sequentially
   - 3 reps = pursue 10 banks simultaneously
   - **Impact:** 3x more customers in same time

2. **Proper security & compliance**
   - 3 audits vs 2
   - SEC no-action letter
   - $100M insurance coverage
   - **Impact:** Banks won't sign without this

3. **18 months vs 15 months runway**
   - Bank deals take 12-18 months to close
   - 15 months = can close 1-2 banks
   - 18 months = can close 3-5 banks
   - **Impact:** 3x revenue

**Bottom Line:** For 67% more capital, you get 3x the return. Best $2M you'll invest.

---

## **ALTERNATIVE: MILESTONE-BASED STRUCTURE**

**Tranche 1:** $3M (initial close)
- 12-month runway
- Deploy immediately
- Milestones: 5 customers, $5M ARR

**Tranche 2:** $2M (upon hitting milestones)
- Same valuation (investor-friendly)
- Extends runway to 18 months
- De-risked for investors

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Lower initial risk for investors
- ✅ You still get full $5M if successful
- ✅ Avoids bridge round dilution later

---

## **INVESTOR RETURNS**

### **Conservative Case ($3M raise)**
```
2025: $0 ARR (pre-launch)
2026: $5M ARR
2027: $15M ARR
2028: Series A at $50M valuation (3x revenue multiple)

Your $3M stake @ 20% ownership = $10M value
Return: 3.3x in 3 years (52% IRR)
```

### **Base Case ($5M raise)**
```
2025: $0 ARR (pre-launch)
2026: $10M ARR
2027: $30M ARR
2028: Series A at $150M valuation (5x revenue multiple)

Your $5M stake @ 20% ownership = $30M value
Return: 6x in 3 years (82% IRR)
```

### **Upside Case ($5M raise + excellent execution)**
```
2025: $0 ARR
2026: $15M ARR
2027: $50M ARR
2028: Series A at $300M valuation (6x revenue multiple)

Your $5M stake @ 20% ownership = $60M value
Return: 12x in 3 years (126% IRR)
```

## **WHY NOW?**

**Perfect Timing:**

1. **Basel III Regulations (2023+)**
   - Banks must report intraday liquidity
   - Real-time ownership tracking now mandatory
   - We're the only solution

2. **Crypto + TradFi Convergence**
   - BlackRock tokenizing securities
   - JPMorgan on blockchain
   - Banks need blockchain visibility tools

3. **Recent Failures Create Demand**
   - Archegos ($10B loss) → margin call failure
   - FTX collapse → ownership confusion
   - Banks desperate for visibility

4. **Technology Ready**
   - 20+ blockchains mature enough
   - Oracle infrastructure proven (Chainlink = $15B)
   - APIs available (Bloomberg, SWIFT)

**This market didn't exist 2 years ago. Won't be available 2 years from now (competitors will catch up).**

---

## **COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE**

**Moat:**
1. **Multi-Chain Oracle Consensus** → Proprietary algorithm (patentable)
2. **First Mover** → Signing banks now = 5-year contracts
3. **Network Effects** → More banks = more accurate data
4. **Integration Depth** → 20+ blockchains + SWIFT + legacy systems (18 months for competitor to replicate)
5. **Regulatory Clarity** → SEC no-action letter = barrier to entry

**Competitors:**
- Chainlink: Only blockchain oracles (not ownership tracking)
- Bloomberg: Legacy systems only (no blockchain)
- Ledger: Custody-focused (not real-time tracking)
- **Nobody does what we do across all systems**

   - Month 2: Deploy capital, start hiring

---

## **CLOSING STATEMENT**

**"$100-150 billion is locked up because financial institutions can't answer one simple question: 'Who owns what, when?'**

**We built the system that answers that question in real-time, across every blockchain and legacy system.**

**The market needs this now. Basel III regulations are forcing banks to adopt. We have a 2-year window before competitors catch up.**

**$5 million gets us to $30 million ARR and a $150M Series A. That's a 6x return in 3 years.**

**The question isn't whether this will work. The question is: Do you want to be part of it?"**

---

## **APPENDIX: FAQ**

**Q: Why you? What's your unfair advantage?**  
A: [Your background]. Plus, we have the product 90% built already. Competitors are 18 months behind.

**Q: What if a big player (Bloomberg, Chainlink) enters?**  
A: We'll have 5-year contracts with 15+ banks by then. Network effects + switching costs = defensible. Bloomberg doesn't do blockchain. Chainlink doesn't do legacy systems. We do both.

**Q: Regulatory risk?**  
A: We're an oracle/data provider, not a broker-dealer. Not regulated like exchanges. Getting SEC no-action letter for clarity. Legal budget: $350K.

**Q: Customer acquisition cost?**  
A: Banks: $500K (12-month sales cycle). But $2-5M/year contracts = 4-10x LTV/CAC. 5-year contracts = 20-50x.

**Q: Technical risk?**  
A: Product 90% done. We've solved the hard parts (multi-oracle consensus). Remaining: polish + audits.

**Q: What if crypto crashes?**  
A: Our customers are banks managing collateral. They need us MORE during volatility (margin calls, liquidations). Counter-cyclical revenue.

**Q: Why not bootstrap?**  
A: Banks require audits ($400K), insurance ($250K), sales team ($600K/yr). Can't bootstrap enterprise B2B. Need $3-5M minimum.

**Q: Exit strategy?**  
A: (1) Series A in 18 months at $150M+, or (2) Strategic acquisition by Bloomberg/Thomson Reuters/ICE for $300M+ (10x revenue multiple), or (3) Continue to IPO (5-7 years, $1B+ valuation if we hit $200M ARR).
