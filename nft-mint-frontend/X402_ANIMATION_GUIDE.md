        • Scale: 0.95 → 1.0
        • Smooth cubic-bezier easing
   ↓
T=0.2s: Revenue model cards appear
        • Card 1 (Equal Split): fadeInUp with 0.1s delay
        • Card 2 (Weighted): fadeInUp with 0.2s delay
        • Card 3 (Creator Split): fadeInUp with 0.3s delay
        • Staggered cascade effect!

## 🎨 **Animation Details**

### **Main Container Animation:**
```css
@keyframes expandDown {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(-20px) scale(0.95);
    max-height: 0;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0) scale(1);
    max-height: 3000px;
  }
}

/* Applied with cubic-bezier for smooth acceleration */
animation: expandDown 0.5s cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);
```

**Effect:** 
- Starts slow (gentle ease-in)
- Accelerates in middle (momentum)
- Soft landing (smooth ease-out)
- Feels natural and polished ✨

### **Revenue Model Cards (Staggered):**
```css
@keyframes fadeInUp {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(20px);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}

/* Card 1: delay 0.1s */
/* Card 2: delay 0.2s */
/* Card 3: delay 0.3s */
```

**Effect:**
- Cards appear one after another
- Creates cascade/waterfall effect
- Each card slides up as it fades in
- Professional, Apple-like animation 🍎

```css
transition-all duration-300
hover:transform hover:scale-105
```

**Effect:**

```

**Effect:**

  rgba(153,69,255,0.08) 100%
);
background-size: 200% 200%;
```

**Effect:**
- Subtle gradient from cyan to purple

### **Sequential Fade-Ins:**
```
Revenue Models:  0.1s delay

```

**Effect:**
- Elements appear in logical reading order

## 💡 **Animation Principles Used**

### **1. Easing Curves:**
```
cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)
```
- Starts slow (gentle acceleration)
- Middle is fast (momentum)
- Ends slow (soft landing)
- Same as iOS/Apple animations 🍎

### **2. Staggered Cascade:**
```
Card 1: 0.1s
Card 2: 0.2s
Card 3: 0.3s
```
- Creates waterfall effect
- Guides user's eye
- Feels orchestrated, not random

### **3. Opacity + Transform:**
```
opacity: 0 → 1
translateY: -20px → 0
scale: 0.95 → 1.0
```
- Multiple properties = richer animation
- More interesting than simple fade
- Professional quality

### **4. Gradient Acceleration:**
```
background: linear-gradient(135deg, ...)
background-size: 200% 200%
```
- Preview box has gradient background
- Diagonal flow (135deg)
- Solana colors (cyan → purple)
- Premium feel 💎

## 🎯 **Comparison: Before vs After**
