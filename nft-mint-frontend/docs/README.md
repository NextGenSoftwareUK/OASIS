## 📊 Key Talking Points (Quick Reference)

### **Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)**
"We reduce Solana NFT minting from 45 steps and 4 hours to 12 steps and 10 minutes — zero coding required. We're live on devnet today and expanding to Arbitrum, Polygon, and Base within 12 months. We're the only solution combining simple UI for creators with API access for developers."

### **Problem Statement (1 minute)**
"Currently, minting NFTs on Solana requires developer expertise, command-line tools, and navigating 5+ separate platforms for uploads, metadata, and deployment. This prevents an estimated 500,000 creators from participating. Existing 'simple' solutions either lock users into marketplace ecosystems or lack the features developers need. The market lacks a solution that serves both creators and builders."

### **Solution Overview (1 minute)**
"We built a browser-based NFT minting platform powered by the OASIS provider abstraction system. Non-technical users get a four-step wizard: select configuration, authenticate, upload assets, and mint. Developers get full API access to integrate NFT minting in 10 lines of code. Our architecture supports multiple chains through a unified interface — swap Solana for Arbitrum with a configuration change, not a code rewrite."

### **Market Opportunity (1 minute)**
"We're targeting three segments: 500K independent creators who want to mint without hiring developers, 10K enterprises and brands spending $100K+ on custom NFT infrastructure, and 50K developers who'd rather integrate an API than build from scratch. Conservative projections show $150K ARR in Year 1 scaling to $2.6M in Year 2 as we go multi-chain. The NFT infrastructure market is $2B+ and growing 30-40% annually."

### **Competitive Advantage (1 minute)**
"We're the only solution that's simultaneously simpler than existing tools while being more powerful. 73% fewer steps than Metaplex CLI, but with features marketplace tools don't offer like API access and multi-chain support. Our provider abstraction system is our moat — we can add new chains in weeks while competitors need months of rewrites. We're already architected for the multi-chain future that most solutions will never reach."

### **Traction & Ask (30 seconds)**
"We're live on Solana devnet today with production-ready infrastructure. We're raising $500K to $1M to accelerate multi-chain expansion and user acquisition. Within 90 days we'll have mainnet deployed, Arbitrum integrated, and first revenue. We'd love to discuss how you can be part of building the future of accessible, multi-chain NFT infrastructure."
