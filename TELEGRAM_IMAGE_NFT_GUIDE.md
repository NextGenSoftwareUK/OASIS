## 🔒 Security & Best Practices

### Image Validation:
- ✅ File size checked (Telegram enforces <20MB)
- ✅ Only images accepted (PNG, JPG, JPEG)
- ✅ Unique filename generation
- ✅ IPFS ensures permanent storage

### Privacy:
- ✅ Images stored on IPFS (public, immutable)
- ✅ Filenames include timestamp, not personal data
- ⚠️ Don't upload sensitive/private images!

### Rate Limiting:
- Consider implementing per-user limits
- Monitor Pinata usage (free tier: 1GB storage, 100 pins/month)
- Track NFT minting costs

---

## 💰 Cost Considerations

### Pinata (IPFS Storage):
- **Free Tier:**
  - 1 GB storage
  - 100 pins/month
  - Perfect for testing!
  
- **Paid Plans:**
  - More storage & pins as you scale
  - Starting at $20/month

### Solana (NFT Minting):
- ~0.01 SOL per mint (~$2-3)
- Paid by treasury wallet
- Consider pricing strategy for production
