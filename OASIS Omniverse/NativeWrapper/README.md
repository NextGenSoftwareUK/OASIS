# NativeWrapper — **DEPRECATED – DO NOT USE**

**Do not use NativeWrapper.** ODOOM and OQuake use **STARAPIClient** only. This folder is kept for reference only.

For building and using the STAR API with ODOOM/OQuake, see:

- **[../STARAPIClient/README.md](../STARAPIClient/README.md)** – current client, build, and deployment
- [../README.md](../README.md) – OASIS Omniverse overview

The build guides in this folder (BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md, QUICK_VISUAL_STUDIO_BUILD.md, VISUAL_STUDIO_BUILD_GUIDE.md) describe the old C++ wrapper and are retained for historical reference.
