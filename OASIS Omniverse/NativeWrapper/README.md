# NativeWrapper (legacy – not currently used)

**NativeWrapper is not currently being used.** It was obsoleted by the C# **STARAPIClient**, which produces `star_api.dll` and `star_api.lib` and is what ODOOM and OQuake use today.

This folder is kept for reference only. For building and using the STAR API with ODOOM/OQuake, see:

- **[../STARAPIClient/README.md](../STARAPIClient/README.md)** – current client, build, and deployment
- [../README.md](../README.md) – OASIS Omniverse overview

The build guides in this folder (BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md, QUICK_VISUAL_STUDIO_BUILD.md, VISUAL_STUDIO_BUILD_GUIDE.md) describe the old C++ wrapper and are retained for historical reference.
