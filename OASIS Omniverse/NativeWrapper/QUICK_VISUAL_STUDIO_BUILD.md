# Quick Visual Studio Build Guide (legacy)

**Note:** NativeWrapper is **not currently used**; it was obsoleted by the C# STARAPIClient. ODOOM and OQuake use STARAPIClient. This guide is for reference only.

## 🚀 Fastest Method (3 Steps)

### 1. Open Project
- **Visual Studio** → **File** → **Open** → **Project**
- Navigate to: `C:\Source\OASIS-master\Game Integration\NativeWrapper\`
- Open: **star_api.vcxproj**

### 2. Set Configuration
- **Toolbar**: Select **Release** and **x64**

### 3. Build
- Press **Ctrl+Shift+B** (or **Build** → **Build Solution**)

## ✅ Done!

Check `build\Release\star_api.dll` exists.

## 🎯 That's It!

The library is now built and ready to use with DOOM!
