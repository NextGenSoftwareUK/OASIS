# 🚀 START HERE - Kleros Integration Manager POC

**Your complete interview package**

---

## ⚡ QUICK START (5 Minutes)

### 1. Understand the Architecture (2 min)

**Open**: `KLEROS_OASIS_ARCHITECTURE_CLARIFIED.md`

**Key Point**: 
- OASIS = Kleros team's **internal tool** ✅
- Partners use **standard Web3** (Ethers.js, Web3.js) ✅
- Like Stripe: internal tools vs merchant API

### 2. Run the Demo (2 min)

```bash
cd kleros-frontend-poc
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

**Click through**: Architecture → Team View → Partner View

### 3. Review the Pitch (1 min)

**30-Second Version**:
> "I built OASIS + AssetRail - multi-chain infrastructure for Kleros's internal operations.  
> Deploy to 15+ chains in 1-2 days (vs 2-4 weeks). Save $200k-400k/year.  
> Partners use standard Web3 - they never see OASIS. Your team moves 10x faster."

## 🎯 THE TWO-LAYER ARCHITECTURE

### Layer 1: Kleros Team (Uses OASIS/AssetRail)

```
Kleros Team → AssetRail SC-Gen → Generate Contracts
                   ↓
              OASIS Platform → Deploy to 15+ Chains
                   ↓
              Monitor Dashboard → Unified View
```

**Value**: Deploy new chain in 1-2 days (vs 2-4 weeks)

### Layer 2: Partners (Use Standard Web3)

```
Partner → Read Kleros Docs → Install npm Package
           ↓
        Use Ethers.js → Create Dispute → Get Ruling
```

**Experience**: Just like integrating Uniswap or Aave
