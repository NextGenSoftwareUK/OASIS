## 💼 OASIS VALUE-ADD

### How OASIS Accelerates Kleros Integrations

**For EVM Chains** (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base):
- ✅ Unified API - developers integrate once, deploy anywhere
- ✅ Cost optimization - automatic chain selection based on gas
- ✅ Auto-failover - if Ethereum congested, route to Polygon

**For Non-EVM Chains** (Solana, Cosmos, Cardano):
- ✅ OASIS already integrated these chains
- ✅ Can port Kleros contracts with chain-specific expertise
- ✅ Open entirely new markets (Solana DeFi, Cosmos IBC, etc.)

**For dApp Developers**:
- ✅ OASIS + Kleros = instant multi-chain arbitration
- ✅ Example: NFT marketplace on Solana gets Kleros via OASIS
- ✅ No need to learn multiple blockchain SDKs

---

## 📈 COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

### Why These Projects Need Kleros (vs. Alternatives)

**vs. Centralized Arbitration**:
- ❌ Centralized = single point of failure, bias risk
- ✅ Kleros = decentralized, transparent, provably fair

**vs. Manual Governance**:
- ❌ Manual = slow, expensive, doesn't scale
- ✅ Kleros = fast (days not months), economical, scalable

**vs. Building Custom Solution**:
- ❌ Custom = reinvent the wheel, security risks, maintenance burden
- ✅ Kleros = proven system, 900+ disputes resolved, just plug in

**vs. No Arbitration**:
- ❌ No arbitration = disputes → users leave platform
- ✅ Kleros = retain users, build trust, competitive advantage

## 🔑 KEY TALKING POINTS (Per Target)

### Uniswap
*"Your OTC desk handles $100M+ trades monthly. Without trustless arbitration, you're leaving institutional money on the table. Kleros enables decentralized escrow that matches your protocol's ethos."*

### OpenSea
*"2-3% fraud rate costs you millions in lost trust. Kleros arbitration can cut that in half while differentiating you from competitors. Buyers get peace of mind, you get more volume."*

### Magic Eden
*"You're multi-chain, but arbitration is still Ethereum-only. With OASIS, we can bring Kleros to Solana in 3 months. Be the first Solana marketplace with decentralized disputes."*

### Aave
*"Contested liquidations are PR nightmares. Kleros gives users a fair appeal process. Even if most appeals fail, having the option builds protocol legitimacy."*

### Gitcoin
*"You fund public goods. Kleros *is* a public good. Natural partnership. Your bounty workers get fair dispute resolution, you reduce grant fraud. Win-win."*
