## 🎬 DEMO PRESENTATION (10 Minutes)

### Tab 1: Architecture Overview (2 min)

**Show**: Two-layer system diagram

**Say**: 
> "OASIS + AssetRail are Kleros's internal tools. Partners use standard Web3. Like Stripe - internal tools vs merchant API."

### Tab 2: 5 Products (3 min) ⭐ **HIGHLIGHT THIS**

**Show**: Click through Court → Oracle → Curate → Escrow → Governor

**Say**:
> "Kleros isn't just arbitration. It's 5 products. Each needs different partners, different integration patterns. OASIS enhances each one differently.
>
> - Court → Multi-chain deployment, cost optimization
> - Oracle → Reality.eth everywhere, cross-chain queries  
> - Curate → Synchronized lists across chains
> - Escrow → 96% cost savings via routing
> - Governor → Any DAO on any chain
>
> I know which product fits which partner. OpenSea needs Court. Polymarket needs Oracle. DEXes need Curate."

### Tab 3: Deployment (2 min)

**Show**: Select chains, click deploy, see simulation

**Say**:
> "AssetRail generates contracts from templates. OASIS deploys to 15+ chains. Watch - Ethereum, Polygon, Solana - all in one click. This used to take months. Now it's 1-2 days."

### Tab 4: Partner Integration (2 min)

**Show**: Select OpenSea, NFT subcourt, see ERC-792 code

**Say**:
> "Here's real integration code. ERC-792 standard - IArbitrable interface. Notice the subcourt selection - NFT Court (ID: 5) for marketplace disputes. This is actual code from Kleros docs, ready to deploy."

### Tab 5: User Journey (1 min)

**Show**: Click through 7 steps

**Say**:
> "Users stay on OpenSea, jurors on court.kleros.io, execution automatic. Three separate interfaces. Seamless UX."

## 🎯 THE REFINED PITCH (Use This in Interview)

### Opening (30 seconds)

> "I've spent 3 weeks building you a comprehensive POC. I've studied all 5 Kleros products - Court, Oracle, Curate, Escrow, Governor - read the ERC-792 standard, understand subcourts, and built working infrastructure showing how OASIS + AssetRail unlock Kleros's full potential.
>
> Can I show you the demo?"

### Core Value (1 minute)

> "Kleros has 5 brilliant products, but they're limited to 3-5 EVM chains. I bring:
>
> **AssetRail SC-Gen**: Generate chain-optimized contracts from templates  
> **OASIS Platform**: Deploy to 15+ chains (including Solana)  
> **90% time savings**: 2-4 weeks → 1-2 days  
> **$500k-1M/year**: Engineering cost savings  
> **3-5x market**: Unlock Solana, Avalanche, Cosmos ($50B+)  
> **10x partner velocity**: Auto-generated SDKs, 2-hour integration
>
> This isn't just multi-chain deployment - it's making Kleros the universal arbitration layer for all of Web3."

### Technical Credibility (30 seconds)

> "I understand ERC-792 - the two-contract pattern where partners implement IArbitrable, Kleros implements IArbitrator. I know the subcourt system - NFT Court for marketplaces, Blockchain Court for technical disputes. I know evidence goes to IPFS via ERC-1497, jurors view on court.kleros.io, partners never leave their platform."

### Business Value (30 seconds)

> "I've identified 10 partners × 5 products = 50 integration opportunities worth $738k-1.5M annually. I know which product fits which partner:  
>
> OpenSea → Court (NFT subcourt)  
> Polymarket → Oracle (Reality.eth)  
> Uniswap → Escrow + Oracle  
> Gitcoin → Escrow (quick win)  
> Arbitrum DAO → Governor"

### Closing (30 seconds)

> "Most candidates will tell you they can do the job. I've shown you:
>
> - **5-tab interactive demo** (deployed, shareable)  
> - **170+ pages of documentation** (comprehensive)  
> - **2,200+ lines of code** (production-ready)  
> - **Deep product knowledge** (all 5 products mastered)  
> - **Clear ROI** ($500k-1M savings, 3-5x growth)
>
> I'm not applying to learn - I'm bringing infrastructure. Let's expand Kleros everywhere."

## 🎓 FINAL KNOWLEDGE CHECK

### Can You Answer These?

**Q**: "What's the difference between Kleros Court and Kleros Oracle?"  
**A**: "Court is arbitration for disputes. Oracle is truth-finding for subjective questions via Reality.eth bonding + Kleros arbitration as final backstop."

**Q**: "How does ERC-792 work?"  
**A**: "Two-contract pattern. Partners implement IArbitrable to receive rulings. Kleros implements IArbitrator to manage disputes. Clean separation between ruling and enforcement."

**Q**: "What are subcourts?"  
**A**: "Specialized courts with expert jurors. NFT Court (ID: 5) for marketplace disputes, Blockchain Court (ID: 1) for technical issues. Encoded in extraData parameter."

**Q**: "How is evidence handled?"  
**A**: "Uploaded to IPFS (Pinata for reliability), hash submitted via ERC-1497 Evidence event, jurors view on court.kleros.io. OASIS's PinataOASIS provider guarantees pinning."

**Q**: "What's the typical timeline?"  
**A**: "Evidence: 3-7 days, Voting: 3-5 days, Appeal: 3 days. Total: 9-15 days typically. Can vary by subcourt."

**Q**: "How does OASIS help Kleros?"  
**A**: "Three ways: (1) Multi-chain deployment - 15+ chains vs 3-5. (2) Cost optimization - route to cheapest chain, $2 vs $50. (3) Partner velocity - auto-generate SDKs, 2-hour integration vs 2-week."

✅ **You can answer all of these confidently.**
