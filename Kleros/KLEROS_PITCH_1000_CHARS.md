I've architected OASIS with 50+ provider integrations - the exact "dapps as building bricks" philosophy Kleros needs. Each provider (Ethereum, Solana, MongoDB, Telegram) is a composable block - precisely how Kleros should integrate into partner dapps.

PROVEN INTEGRATION MANAGEMENT:
✓ Researched & integrated 50+ platforms
✓ Created $180k partnership proposals
✓ Wrote 900-line integration guides
✓ Delivered 2-4 week MVPs
✓ Managed research → proposal → implementation → support

TECHNICAL + BUSINESS:
• Technical: 15+ blockchains, smart contracts, architecture
• Business: ROI analysis, value propositions, deal closing
• Communication: Exec summaries, dev docs, user guides

IMMEDIATE VALUE:
Week 1-2: Identify 20+ targets (DeFi, NFT, DAO)
Week 3-4: Deliver 5 proposals using proven templates
Month 2: Close first 2-3 deals

OASIS provider architecture IS integration management at scale. Same methodology, ready to scale Kleros partnerships immediately.
