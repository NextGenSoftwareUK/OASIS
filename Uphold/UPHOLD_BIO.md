## Application-Specific Bio (Tailored for Uphold)

Max Gershfield is a creative technologist who has built production-ready infrastructure that directly addresses Uphold's opportunity to lead the tokenized real-world assets market. With 10 years of enterprise experience at Uber and leading agencies, plus 4 years developing multi-chain blockchain systems, Max combines technical depth with strategic business thinking.

**What I've Built That Matters for Uphold:**

**OASIS HyperDrive Experience** - Extensive hands-on experience working with universal multi-chain infrastructure supporting 50+ blockchains with automatic failover and 99.9% uptime. Built business use cases, operations workflows, and production applications leveraging this infrastructure. This experience enables platforms like Uphold to add new blockchains in days instead of months, reducing integration time by 80% and maintenance costs significantly.

**x402 Revenue Distribution Protocol** - Production-ready system for automatically distributing revenue (rent, dividends, interest) to token holders in 5-30 seconds. Already proven with 432 MetaBricks NFTs receiving passive income from an API business. This solves the critical challenge of how to distribute monthly rent to 10,000 token holders—a requirement for any RWA tokenization platform.

**Quantum Street Digital Asset Treasury** - Developed institutional-grade Digital Asset Treasury platform combining altcoin trading with RWA yield generation. Built compliant RWA tokenization infrastructure supporting multi-blockchain deployment (Ethereum, Solana, Kadena) through Wyoming Trust structures, demonstrating deep understanding of regulatory considerations, compliance requirements, and the intersection of traditional finance with blockchain technology. This experience directly informs my approach to bringing yield-generating digital assets to both retail and institutional customers.

**Why This Matters:**
The RWA tokenization market represents a $68 trillion opportunity, with $16 trillion projected by 2030. Uphold's "Anything-to-Anything" brand positioning is perfect for RWAs, and with the right infrastructure, Uphold could launch RWA products in 6 months instead of 2 years. I've already built much of that infrastructure.

**My Ideal Role:**
My ideal role involves bringing a new generation of yield-generating digital assets to both retail and institutional customers—solving challenges that blend creative and technical fields. This aligns perfectly with Uphold's opportunity to democratize access to tokenized real-world assets, combining the transparency and efficiency of blockchain with the stability and yield of traditional assets.

**My Unique Value:**
- Production-ready code (not prototypes) with comprehensive documentation
- Proven track record: 4x grant winner, Superteam UK contributor
- Strategic thinking: Detailed financial modeling and market analysis
- Enterprise experience: Managed teams, launched products reaching millions
- Full-stack capability: From smart contracts to frontend UX to business strategy
- Institutional-grade experience: Built Quantum Street's Digital Asset Treasury combining altcoin trading with RWA yield

I'm excited about the opportunity to help Uphold become the #1 platform for democratizing access to tokenized real-world assets.
