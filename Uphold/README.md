## 💡 The Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

> "I've built infrastructure that helps platforms like Uphold tokenize real-world assets with automatic revenue distribution. Think: fractional real estate where monthly rent automatically flows to token holders in 30 seconds. I've already built this with 432 NFTs earning passive income from an API business - it works in production today. With 50+ blockchains integrated and proven distribution tech, I could help Uphold launch RWA products in 6 months instead of 2 years, capturing the $16 trillion tokenization opportunity before Coinbase and BlackRock own it."
