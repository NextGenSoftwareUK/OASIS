Dear HSBC Hiring Committee,

I am writing to apply for the Director, Strategic Innovation position within Group Innovation and Digital Partnerships. I bring an unusual combination of expertise that aligns precisely with your requirements: 10 years of enterprise-scale creative strategy at Uber and leading London agencies, combined with 4 years of hands-on innovation in the most disruptive sector of financial services—blockchain and Web3.

Unlike strategists who theorize about emerging technologies, I deploy them. I've architected OASIS Web4, a universal infrastructure platform connecting 50+ blockchains with intelligent auto-failover systems. I've built x402, a protocol that automatically distributes platform revenue to NFT holders via smart contracts, demonstrating programmable profit-sharing for tokenized securities. I've developed Quantum Street, a compliant real-world asset tokenization platform using Wyoming Trust structures. These aren't proof-of-concepts—they're production systems serving real users.

But I also understand enterprise strategy and stakeholder management at global scale. At Uber (2018-2022), I led CRM copywriting for EMEA, spearheading product launches for Uber Lite, Uber Rewards, Uber Premium, and Uber Freight—initiatives reaching millions of users across 54 markets. I managed regional copywriters across Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia, ensuring brand consistency while adapting to local regulations and cultural contexts. I contributed to Uber's global brand bible and creative playbooks, creating strategic frameworks that guided innovation across the organization.

**What I bring to HSBC's Strategic Innovation team:**

**Technical Expertise in Emerging Technologies**: Four years building production systems across Solana, Ethereum, Radix, and Kadena blockchains has given me ground-truth understanding of which innovations genuinely threaten traditional banking versus which are speculative. I don't read reports about DeFi, stablecoins, and programmable financial instruments—I've built them. This enables me to identify genuine disruptors and craft strategic responses based on technical feasibility, not hype.

**Proven Innovation Framework Development**: As a 4x grant winner (Solana, Arbitrum, Radix, Thrive), I've repeatedly pitched innovation to funding committees and delivered production systems that validate those proposals. I've developed frameworks for evaluating emerging technologies across technical feasibility, market timing, competitive positioning, and business model viability—exactly the lens needed for HSBC's innovation portfolio.

**Intellectual Property and Commercialization Focus**: I've built systems with patentable innovations—OASIS HyperDrive's intelligent auto-failover across heterogeneous blockchain providers, x402's programmable revenue distribution protocol, and STAR CLI's cross-platform digital asset generator. At HSBC, I would apply the same lens to identify technical innovations emerging from R&D and partnerships, evaluate commercial potential, and build a patent portfolio that protects HSBC's competitive position while generating licensing revenue.

**Academic and Partnership Ecosystem**: As a Superteam UK contributor and consultant at Flight3 (the UK's top Web3 creative agency), I'm embedded in the UK's innovation ecosystem—the exact networks HSBC seeks to leverage. I've collaborated with blockchain foundations, participated in research initiatives, and navigated grant funding ecosystems. I understand how to identify which university research programs, innovation hubs, and technology providers are worth partnering with, and how to structure collaborations that generate publishable research, patentable IP, and talent pipelines.

**Global Leadership and Stakeholder Engagement**: Managing teams across 54 markets at Uber taught me to balance global strategic vision with local execution autonomy, engage stakeholders from technical teams to C-suite, and navigate complex organizational structures. In Web3, I've coordinated distributed teams across smart contracts, backend, frontend, and compliance. At HSBC, I can lead a global Strategic Innovation team while facilitating cross-functional collaboration through workshops, hackathons, and innovation sprints.

**Competitive Intelligence and Market Analysis**: I've analyzed competitive landscapes across 50+ blockchain protocols, written market analyses for grant proposals (identifying $5B+ TAM for x402, $68T for RWA tokenization), and positioned OASIS against competitors like Chainlink, Moralis, and Web3Core. This experience translates directly to monitoring emerging threats from DeFi protocols, neobanks, stablecoins, and AI-driven financial services—and identifying HSBC's strategic response options.

My journey from creative agencies (TBWA, JWT) to Uber's global product launches to blockchain development reflects an entrepreneurial mindset and learning agility. In 2022, I made an unconventional career transition—completing an intensive coding bootcamp at Codam.nl and diving into full-stack blockchain development. Since then, I've shipped three production systems, won four grants, and established myself as a trusted contributor in the UK's Web3 ecosystem.

**What makes me different from other candidates:**

Most candidates will have either strategic consulting experience OR hands-on technical building OR banking domain expertise. I combine enterprise-scale strategy (Uber, 10 years) with production-level technical execution (4 systems shipped) and deep expertise in the most disruptive technologies facing financial services. I can identify which innovations threaten HSBC's business model, lead strategic responses, and execute from concept to production—because I've done all three in Web3.

The technologies I've mastered—blockchain interoperability, programmable financial instruments, tokenized securities, decentralized identity, privacy-preserving computation—are precisely the innovations HSBC must understand to stay ahead of disruptors. I bring not just knowledge but proven execution: systems running in production, grants won through competitive pitches, and partnerships formed across innovation ecosystems.

I am particularly excited about this role because it combines two things I excel at: identifying bleeding-edge technologies that will reshape financial services, and leading global teams to develop strategic responses. HSBC has incredible advantages—global presence, regulatory licenses, customer trust, capital—but staying ahead requires someone who can separate genuine innovation from hype, engage stakeholders from engineers to regulators, and execute with both strategic clarity and technical depth.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my unique combination of enterprise strategy, hands-on innovation, and emerging technology expertise can help HSBC lead the next decade of financial services innovation. I am available for an interview at your convenience and can provide additional portfolio materials demonstrating the production systems I've built.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to HSBC's innovation leadership.

Sincerely,

**Max Gershfield**
