# NLog Extention For NextGen Software Logging

NLog implemention/extnetion of ILogger interface for [NextGenSoftware.Logging package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NextGenSoftware.Logging).

So far coloured console log support for NLog has not been implemented, this will be done later, but if you need animated coloured console logging then use the DefaultLogger built in to the Logging package above... ;-)

Configuring and using Logging is much simpler than NLog and is one of the reasons it was created in the first place! ;-)
