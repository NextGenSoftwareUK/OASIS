## 💡 The 3-Minute Pitch

### 1. Problem (45 seconds)
"Currently, minting NFTs on Solana requires developer expertise, command-line tools, and navigating 45+ steps across 5+ platforms. This prevents an estimated 500,000 creators from participating. Custom development costs $100K-$250K and takes 3-6 months. Existing 'simple' solutions either lock users into marketplace ecosystems or lack the features developers need."

### 2. Solution (60 seconds)
"We built a browser-based NFT minting platform powered by the OASIS provider abstraction system. Non-technical users get a four-step wizard: select configuration, authenticate, upload assets, and mint. Developers get full API access to integrate NFT minting in 10 lines of code. Our architecture supports multiple chains through a unified interface — swap Solana for Arbitrum with a configuration change, not a code rewrite."

### 3. Market & Business Model (60 seconds)
"We're targeting three segments: 500K independent creators who want to mint without hiring developers, 10K enterprises spending $100K+ on NFT infrastructure, and 50K developers who'd rather integrate an API than build from scratch. We have four revenue streams: transaction fees, premium subscriptions, white-label licensing, and developer API plans. Conservative projections show $150K ARR in Year 1 scaling to $2.6M in Year 2 as we go multi-chain."

### 4. Ask (15 seconds)
"We're raising $500K to $1M to accelerate multi-chain expansion and user acquisition. We're also offering white-label licensing for $5K-$50K to partners who want to launch NFT platforms without the development cost."

## ❓ Objection Handlers

### "Why not just use Metaplex CLI?"
*"Metaplex CLI requires coding expertise and 45+ steps. We reduce that to 12 steps with zero code. We're targeting the 500K+ creators who can't code, not the developers who already know CLI."*

### "What about SolSea or Magic Eden?"
*"Those are marketplaces that lock you into their ecosystem with fees. We're a white-label platform with API access and no lock-in. Plus we're multi-chain, they're Solana-only."*

### "Crossmint already does multi-chain NFTs"
*"Crossmint charges 3-5% platform fees and is custodial. We're self-custodial with 0.1% fees. Also, they don't offer white-label licensing like we do."*

### "Can't I just build this myself?"
*"Yes, for $150K-$250K and 3-6 months of development. We're offering it for $15K-$50K in 2-4 weeks. That's 85-95% savings. Plus you get 5 chains instead of 1."*

### "Isn't the NFT market dead?"
*"NFT trading volume is down from 2021 peak, but NFT utility is exploding. Enterprises are using NFTs for loyalty, credentials, tickets, gaming. The infrastructure market is $2B+ and growing 30-40% annually."*

### "What if you fail or go out of business?"
*"Self-hosted license gives you complete source code. For enterprise deals, we offer escrow arrangements. You own the technology."*
