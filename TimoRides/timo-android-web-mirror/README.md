## 🛠️ Development

This mirror allows you to:

## 📝 Notes

- This is a **design/prototype tool**, not a production app
- Some features are placeholders (maps, real data)
- Focus is on visual design and user experience
- Changes here can be translated to Android XML layouts

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Add the Timo logo to `/public/timo-logo.png`
2. Create onboarding illustrations
3. Add more screens as needed
4. Implement interactive components
5. Add form validation
