# Universal Asset Token (UAT) - One-Pager
**Cross-Chain Real World Asset Tokenization Standard**  
*Version 1.0 | October 17, 2025 | AssetRail - Quantum Securities Platform*

---

## 🎯 What is UAT?

A **modular, extensible token standard** for fractional ownership of real-world assets across **Ethereum, Solana, and Radix** blockchains. UAT provides a unified metadata framework that supports property tokenization, trust structures, yield distribution, and compliance tracking.

## ⚠️ The Problem

Current RWA tokenization faces critical gaps:

- ❌ **Inconsistent metadata** across blockchains (Ethereum, Solana, Radix)
- ❌ **Limited extensibility** for different asset types (real estate, art, IP, commodities)
- ❌ **No standardized trust/legal wrapper** integration at token level
- ❌ **Fragmented yield distribution** tracking
- ❌ **Compliance gaps** for regulatory requirements (KYC, accreditation, jurisdiction)

---

## ✅ The Solution

A modular metadata standard that:

- ✓ Works across **all supported blockchains**
- ✓ Supports **multiple asset classes**
- ✓ Embeds **trust/legal structures** (Wyoming Statutory Trusts)
- ✓ Tracks **yield and distributions**
- ✓ Enables **compliance and regulatory integration**
- ✓ Compatible with **existing NFT standards** (ERC-721, ERC-1155, Metaplex, Radix)

    "square_footage": 3500
  },
  
  "yield_distribution": {
    "annual_net_income": 53440,
    "per_token_annual": 15.27,
    "yield_percentage": 7.48,
    "distribution_frequency": "quarterly"
