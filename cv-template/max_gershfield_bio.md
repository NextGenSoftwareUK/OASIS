## About Section (for portfolio website)
I'm a creative technologist focused on building full-stack web3 systems at the intersection of technical innovation and compelling user experience.

My journey started in London's creative agencies and Uber, where I spent 10 years crafting campaigns and building CRM strategies for global brands. In 2022, I made the leap into blockchain development, and I haven't looked back.

Since then, I've contributed to OASIS Web4's cross-chain interoperability platform, built Metabricks.xyz (a full-stack NFT marketplace), and developed Quantum Street's RWA tokenization system. I'm a 4x grant winner across Solana, Arbitrum, Radix, and Thrive ecosystems, and an active Superteam UK contributor.

What excites me most is working on projects that demand both technical depth and creative thinking—whether that's building smart contract systems, designing UX for complex blockchain interactions, or crafting the narrative that makes cutting-edge technology accessible.

I specialize in React/Next.js, TypeScript, Solana/EVM/Radix development, .NET, and still bring my copywriting and brand strategy background to every project. Currently consulting at Flight3, the UK's top web3 creative agency.

**Let's build something interesting together.**
