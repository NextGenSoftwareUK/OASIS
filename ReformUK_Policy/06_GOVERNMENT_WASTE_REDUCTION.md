## 💰 The £50 Billion Waste Problem

### Where Government Waste Happens

1. **Procurement Corruption & Overcharging**
   - PPE scandal (COVID): £billions wasted on unusable equipment
   - HS2: Budget ballooned from £32bn to £100bn+
   - Government contracts to "friends" at inflated prices
   - No transparent competitive bidding

2. **Bureaucratic Inefficiency**
   - Duplicate IT systems across departments
   - Manual processes that should be automated
   - Staff doing paperwork instead of frontline work
   - Layers of unnecessary management

3. **Quango Waste**
   - Hundreds of useless quasi-governmental organizations
   - No accountability or performance metrics
   - Political appointments with high salaries
   - Overlap with existing departments

4. **Back-Office Bloat**
   - NHS: 40%+ staff in back-office roles (not frontline care)
   - Civil Service: Expanded 20%+ under Conservatives
   - Unnecessary consultants earning £1,000s/day
   - Gold-plated pensions for underperformers

5. **Fraud & Benefit Cheats**
   - £billions in COVID support fraud (uncollected)
   - Benefit fraud (disability, unemployment)
   - Tax evasion (VAT carousel fraud)
   - Identity theft for benefits

- Cannot hide the subsidy
- Forces political accountability

#### Alternative Policy Enforcement
- **Reform UK policy**: Stop paying interest
- **Smart contract enforces**: Automatically block interest payments
- **Savings**: £35bn/year retained by Treasury

**Implementation with OASIS:**
- ✅ **Public BoE operations ledger**
- ✅ **Real-time monitoring dashboard**
- ✅ **Smart contract policy enforcement**

**Estimated Savings:**
- **£35bn/year** in stopped bank subsidies
