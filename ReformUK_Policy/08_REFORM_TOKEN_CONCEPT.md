### Token Economics

**Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 $REFORM (1 billion)

**Allocation**:
```
30% (300M) - Public Sale (UK citizens priority)
20% (200M) - Reform UK Treasury (party funding, legally compliant)
15% (150M) - Development & Tech (OASIS integration, partnerships)
15% (150M) - Ecosystem Incentives (staking rewards, governance)
10% (100M) - Strategic Partners (Solana, Ethereum foundations, Superteam UK)
5% (50M) - Team & Advisors (vested 4 years)
5% (50M) - Liquidity Provision (DEX pools)
```

**Vesting**:
- Public sale: Immediate (100%)
- Reform UK Treasury: 4-year linear unlock
- Team/Advisors: 1-year cliff, then 3-year linear
- Ecosystem: Released based on milestones

**Backing** (Stablecoin Variant):
- **$REFORMSTABLE**: GBP-pegged 1:1
- Backed by UK Treasury bonds + reserves
- Redeemable for GBP
- Alternative to CBDC (same stability, more freedom)

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1. Governance (Crypto Policy Voting)

**Token holders vote on UK crypto policy**:

```
Proposal: "Should UK recognize Bitcoin as legal tender?"

Vote with $REFORM:
  - 1 token = 1 vote
  - Quadratic voting (prevents whale control)
  - On-chain results (transparent, tamper-proof)
  
Outcome:
  - Reform UK sees community sentiment
  - Policy shaped by crypto-native voters
  - Democratic, transparent, verifiable
```

**Voting Power**:
- Hold 1,000 $REFORM = vote on minor proposals
- Hold 10,000 $REFORM = vote on major policy
- Hold 100,000 $REFORM = propose new policies

### 2. UK Crypto Hub Access

**$REFORM as access token to UK blockchain ecosystem**:

```
Hold $REFORM → Unlock Benefits:

✓ Priority access to UK crypto accelerators
✓ Tax incentives for blockchain businesses (5% reduction per 10k $REFORM)
✓ Fast-track visa for crypto entrepreneurs (if hold 50k+ $REFORM)
✓ Preferential blockchain company registration
✓ Access to government blockchain contracts (procurement)
✓ Discounted energy for crypto mining (Reform UK's energy policy)
```

**"Great British Bitcoin Strategy"**:
- Make UK attractive to global crypto talent
- Incentivize moving to UK (vs Dubai, Singapore, Swiss)
- $REFORM holders get preferential treatment
- Position UK as crypto capital

### 3. Anti-CBDC Store of Value

**$REFORM as hedge against CBDCs**:

```
Government Announces CBDC Plans
    ↓
Citizens Buy $REFORM as Alternative
    ↓
Self-Custody on 15+ Chains
    ↓
Cannot be Frozen, Monitored, or Controlled
    ↓
Preserves Financial Freedom
```

**Messaging**:
> "Don't trust CBDCs? Buy $REFORM. 
>  Self-custody. Multi-chain. British sovereignty.
>  Your money, your control."

### 4. Staking & Yield

**Stake $REFORM to earn rewards**:

```
Stake $REFORM → Earn Yield

Sources of Yield:
  1. Government blockchain contracts (procurement fees)
  2. UK blockchain company tax revenue (small %)
  3. DEX trading fees (Uniswap, Raydium pools)
  4. Staking rewards (inflationary, capped 3%/year)

Example:
  Stake 10,000 $REFORM
  → Earn 7-12% APY
  → Paid in $REFORM or GBP stablecoin
  → Unlock after 30 days (flexible)
```

**Target APY**: 7-12% (competitive with TradFi savings)

### 5. Cross-Chain DeFi Access

**$REFORM works on all major DeFi platforms**:

```
On Ethereum:
  - Trade on Uniswap
  - Provide liquidity (earn fees)
  - Collateralize for loans (Aave, Compound)

On Solana:
  - Trade on Raydium, Orca
  - Fast, cheap transactions
  - Jupiter aggregator

On Bitcoin:
  - Store of value (Ordinals/Runes)
  - Lightning Network (instant payments)

On Polygon/Arbitrum/Base:
  - Low-fee DeFi
  - NFT ecosystems
  - Gaming integrations
```

**Result**: Maximum utility, maximum liquidity

## 🏛️ Legal & Compliance

### UK Electoral Law Compliance

**Challenge**: Can political parties issue tokens?

**Solution**: Structure as separate entities

```
Reform UK (Political Party)
    ↓
Supports (no direct ownership)
    ↓
Reform UK Foundation (Non-Profit)
    ↓
Issues
    ↓
ReformToken ($REFORM)
    - Utility token (not security)
    - Governance rights
    - No profit promise
    - Compliant with FCA guidance
```

**Legal Opinion Needed From**:
- FCA (Financial Conduct Authority)
- Electoral Commission
- UK crypto lawyers

**Precedents**:
- US: No political party tokens yet (regulatory gray area)
- UK: No precedent (Reform UK could be first)
- Other countries: Limited examples

**Safeguards**:
- KYC/AML compliance
- No profit guarantees (avoid securities law)
- Clear utility (governance, access, not investment)
- Transparent tokenomics
- Regular audits

### FCA Guidance Compliance

**$REFORM as Utility Token (Not Security)**:

✅ **Utility**: Governance voting, ecosystem access, staking
✅ **No profit promise**: Value from utility, not speculation
✅ **Decentralized**: Distributed governance, no central control
✅ **Transparent**: On-chain, public, auditable

**vs. Security Token**:
- ❌ No dividend promise
- ❌ No profit-sharing
- ❌ No company equity
- ❌ No investment contract

**Result**: Likely classifiable as utility token (but legal review essential)

```solidity
// Vote on UK crypto policy proposals
function vote(uint256 proposalId, bool support) public {
    require(balanceOf(msg.sender) >= MIN_VOTE_THRESHOLD);
    proposals[proposalId].votes[support] += balanceOf(msg.sender);
    emit VoteCast(msg.sender, proposalId, support);
}

// Quadratic voting (prevents whale control)

    proposals[proposalId].quadraticVotes[support] += votingPower;
}
```

**Staking Module**:
```solidity
// Stake tokens to earn yield
function stake(uint256 amount, uint256 lockPeriod) public {
    require(amount >= MIN_STAKE);
    stakingBalances[msg.sender] += amount;
    stakingStart[msg.sender] = block.timestamp;
    stakingLockUntil[msg.sender] = block.timestamp + lockPeriod;
    
    // APY based on lock period
    // 30 days = 7% APY
    // 90 days = 10% APY
    // 365 days = 12% APY
}

// Claim rewards
function claimRewards() public {
    uint256 rewards = calculateRewards(msg.sender);
    rewardToken.transfer(msg.sender, rewards);
}
```

**Burning Module**:
```solidity
// Burn tokens from transaction fees
function burnFromFees(uint256 amount) internal {
    _burn(feeCollector, amount);
    totalBurned += amount;
    emit TokensBurned(amount, totalBurned);
}

// 1% of every transaction burned
// Deflationary over time
// Increases scarcity
```
