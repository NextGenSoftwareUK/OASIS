# NextGen Software WEB4 OASIS API Core

This is the heart of the OASIS and contains the core OASIS Engine, architecture, managers, interfaces, helpers, holons/objects, object model, enums, etc. It can be used directly in projects/apps if needed (you can use any of the Managers) but it is highly recommended you use the [OASIS.API.Native.Integrated.EndPoint](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NextGenSoftware.OASIS.API.Native.Integrated.EndPoint) or REST API instead.

Initial Release targeting OASIS API v2.3.1 (Current LIVE REST version):
https://api.oasisweb4.one
