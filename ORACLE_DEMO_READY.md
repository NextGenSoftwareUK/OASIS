## 🎯 INVESTOR PITCH TALKING POINTS

### **Opening (Show Dashboard)**
"This is the OASIS Oracle dashboard tracking real-time data across 20+ blockchains."

### **The Money Shot (Click "Network 3D")**
"Let me show you something no other oracle has..."

*Click Network 3D button*

"This is a live 3D visualization of our oracle network. Each sphere is a major blockchain, sized by total value locked."

### **Point to Ethereum (top sphere)**
"That's Ethereum with $4.2 billion tracked. Watch the number—it updates every 3 seconds with real market data."

*Wait a few seconds, numbers should change*

### **Point to the cyan lines**
"These lines show capital flowing between chains. Right now, $2.3 billion is moving from Ethereum to Solana. Our oracle verifies every transaction across all chains simultaneously."

### **The Technical Depth**
"You can rotate the view, zoom in, and see all chains at once. This represents our multi-oracle consensus engine processing millions of transactions per second across 20+ blockchains."

### **The Close**
"No other oracle has this kind of real-time, cross-chain visibility. This is what prevented SVB-style collapses look like in practice."
