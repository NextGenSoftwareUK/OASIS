# Stablecoin Solution - Voiceover Script

## Script (60-90 seconds when read)

---

**[OPENING]**

**"Introducing zUSD — the first Zcash-backed stablecoin with full privacy protection."**

---

**[THE PROBLEM]**

**"Traditional stablecoins sacrifice privacy. Every transaction is visible on-chain, exposing your financial activity. We believe privacy is a fundamental right."**

---

**[THE SOLUTION]**

**"zUSD combines the stability of an overcollateralized stablecoin with the privacy features of Zcash and Aztec."**

**"Here's how it works: Users lock ZEC as collateral — always maintaining at least 150% collateralization. They can then mint private zUSD tokens on Aztec Network, where all transactions remain completely shielded."**

---

**[KEY FEATURES]**

**"Our solution includes real-time position health monitoring, automatic liquidation protection, and yield generation on locked collateral."**

**"The system tracks collateral ratios continuously, alerting users before positions become undercollateralized."**

---

**[THE TECHNOLOGY]**

**"Built on the OASIS API, zUSD seamlessly bridges Zcash's proven privacy technology with Aztec's private smart contract platform."**

**"Every mint and redeem operation preserves transaction privacy, while maintaining full transparency for position management through secure viewing keys."**

---

**[CLOSING]**

**"zUSD represents a new standard for private stablecoins — combining stability, privacy, and security in one revolutionary platform."**

**"Join us in building a more private financial future."**
