# OASIS Stewardship Charter (v0)

> **Status:** Binding  
> **Scope:** Kernel only  
> **Purpose:** Constrain human authority over the kernel and prevent capture

---

## 1. Purpose of Stewardship

Stewardship exists because:

> Someone must hold the pen.

Pretending otherwise creates hidden authority, not neutrality.

Stewardship is not ownership, governance, or control. It is a temporary custodial role with a narrow mandate.

---

## 2. What Stewards Are Responsible For

Stewards are responsible for:

- maintaining the integrity of the kernel
- enforcing the Kernel Specification
- administering the Cycle Protocol
- publishing required artifacts
- preserving dissent and disagreement
- naming failure conditions when they arise

Stewards are not responsible for:

- growth, funding, adoption, partnerships, messaging, success

---

## 3. What Stewards Explicitly Cannot Do

Stewards may not:

- redefine kernel invariants unilaterally
- suppress dissent
- declare kernel success without evaluation
- bypass the Cycle Protocol
- bind the kernel to any economic system
- grant themselves authority beyond this charter

> **Any attempt to do so is considered a breach.**

---

## 4. Composition of Stewardship (Initial)

Until replaced by an explicit successor mechanism:

- Stewardship consists of a small, named group
- Membership is public
- Terms are finite and declared
- Stewardship is revocable

> **There is no presumption of permanence.**

---

## 5. Decision Authority

Stewards may make procedural decisions only:

- ordering work
- scheduling cycles
- coordinating evaluation

Stewards may not make substantive kernel decisions without:

- explicit documentation
- published dissent
- inclusion in a cycle evaluation

> **Authority is administrative, not doctrinal.**

---

## 6. Dissent Preservation

Stewards are obligated to:

- record dissent verbatim
- publish dissent alongside decisions
- preserve minority positions across cycles

Consensus is not required. Visibility is.

> **If dissent is lost, the cycle is invalid.**

---

## 7. Stewardship Replacement Triggers

Stewardship must be re-evaluated if any of the following occur:

- kernel disagreement persists unresolved across multiple cycles
- stewardship decisions repeatedly override dissent
- external dependency exceeds declared thresholds
- stewards are perceived as indispensable

In such cases, a transition mechanism must be proposed.

---

## 8. Stewardship Expiry

Stewardship is not permanent.

Stewardship expires when:

- a successor structure is explicitly adopted
- or the kernel enters a halted or failed state

> **If no successor exists, stewardship must dissolve rather than entrench.**

---

## 9. Relationship to Funding and Institutions

Stewards may:

- disclose funding sources
- refuse funding that threatens kernel integrity

Stewards may not:

- allow funding to dictate kernel changes
- become economically dependent on a single source

> **Dependency is a form of capture.**

---

## 10. Breach and Remedy

If a steward breaches this charter:

- the breach must be documented
- dissent must be published
- the steward may be removed
- continuation without remedy is invalid

> **No steward is above the charter.**

---

## 11. Final Constraint

This charter exists to make stewardship:

- visible
- limited
- replaceable

> If stewardship becomes comfortable, it is failing.
