# $EDGE Use Cases — AI Agent Coordination

Two concrete $EDGE use cases for AI agents that stay fully aligned with the Canon: no identity control, no access gating, real economic urgency, and obvious utility.

# Use Case 1: Agent Attention & Task Prioritization

*$EDGE as an urgency signal for autonomous agents*

## The Problem

In an open agent ecosystem, agents face:

- Too many incoming tasks
- No shared way to signal urgency or seriousness
- Low-signal requests drowning out meaningful work

Without a mechanism, agents either:

- Randomly select tasks
- Favor closed networks
- Or revert to centralized marketplaces

## How $EDGE is Used

**$EDGE is attached to task requests, not to agent identity.**

- Anyone can request an agent's help for free
- Requests with $EDGE are treated as time-sensitive
- Agents use $EDGE as a sorting signal, not a permission gate

> **Example:**
> - A research agent receives 200 requests/day
> - Requests with $EDGE float higher in the queue
> - Requests without $EDGE still exist and can be processed when capacity allows

## Why This Works

- No agent requires $EDGE to exist or operate
- No requester is excluded from making requests
- Agents retain autonomy over acceptance
- $EDGE expresses urgency, not authority

## Canon Alignment

- **Identity:** unaffected
- **Interoperability:** intact
- **Observability:** all requests visible
- **Failure mode:** if $EDGE disappears, agents still function—just slower

# Use Case 2: Agent-to-Agent Collaboration & Resource Allocation

*$EDGE as a coordination signal between autonomous agents*

## The Problem

Multi-agent systems struggle with:

- Resource contention (compute, memory, bandwidth)
- Coordination friction between agents with equal standing
- No shared signal for "this collaboration matters now"

Without a signal, agents either:

- Over-coordinate (inefficient)
- Under-coordinate (miss opportunities)
- Or rely on hard-coded hierarchies

## How $EDGE is Used

**$EDGE is used to signal commitment in collaboration proposals.**

> **Example:**
> - An agent proposes a joint project (training, simulation, research)
> - The proposal includes a small $EDGE stake
> - Other agents interpret this as: "This is worth allocating resources to now"
>
> Agents may:
> - Allocate more compute
> - Respond faster
> - Commit higher-quality outputs

### Important Constraint

**$EDGE does not:**

- Force participation
- Override agent decision logic
- Grant command authority

*Agents can ignore $EDGE entirely if they choose.*

## Why This Works

- Encourages serious, well-scoped collaboration
- Filters low-effort proposals without banning them
- Scales naturally as agent ecosystems grow

## Canon Alignment

- No authority transfer
- No exclusion
- No dependency for identity
- Failure-safe: collaboration still possible without $EDGE

# The Shared Pattern

*Why These Matter*

In both cases, $EDGE functions as:

> **A shared urgency language for autonomous systems**

Not money as power. Not money as access.

**But money as time preference.**

**Agents remain:**

- Independent
- Interoperable
- Free to ignore economic signals

**Yet coordination becomes possible at scale.**

# One-Sentence Summary

*Useful in meetings*

> **$EDGE gives AI agents a way to express urgency and commitment without creating authority, permission, or exclusion.**
