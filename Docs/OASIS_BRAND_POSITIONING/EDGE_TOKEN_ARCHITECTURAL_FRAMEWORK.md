# $EDGE — The First Tokenized Incentive Layer of OASIS

> **Status:** Architecture Framework (Pre-Tokenomics)  
> **Canonical Alignment:** OASIS Pre-Cycle Canon v1  
> **Scope:** Edge coordination only

---

## 1. Purpose

$EDGE exists to coordinate activity at the edge of OASIS, not to govern, represent, or secure the OASIS kernel. It is an incentive instrument designed to introduce urgency without authority, signal without control, and coordination without capture.

$EDGE is explicitly designed to be:

- Optional
- Replaceable
- Fail-safe

> **If $EDGE cannot fail without damaging OASIS, it must not exist.**

---

## 2. What $EDGE Is Not

$EDGE does not:

- Define or secure identity
- Gate access to persistence or interoperability
- Confer governance rights over the kernel
- Act as a source of canonical truth
- Represent ownership of OASIS or its primitives
- Serve as a universal or mandatory token

> **Any design or implementation that requires $EDGE for identity persistence, interoperability, or observability is a Canon violation.**

---

## 3. Architectural Position

**OASIS is structured as a constrained core with an expansive edge.**

$EDGE operates entirely at the edge.

- The kernel defines invariants
- The edge explores outcomes
- $EDGE influences timing, not truth

*The kernel must remain fully operational, legible, and neutral in the complete absence of $EDGE.*

---

## 4. Function of $EDGE

**$EDGE performs three functions, and only these three:**

### 4.1 Priority Signaling

$EDGE may influence the ordering or visibility of edge-level activities where bandwidth is scarce (e.g. experiment slots, review cycles, attention windows).

It may not:

- Grant exclusive access
- Confer permanent advantage
- Become a prerequisite for participation

### 4.2 Temporal Coordination

$EDGE introduces time-bound urgency. It coordinates *when* things happen, not *whether* they can happen.

**Missed opportunities expire. Access does not.**

### 4.3 Commitment Signaling

$EDGE signals willingness to commit resources (time, attention, risk) to edge activities. It does not validate correctness, legitimacy, or authority.

---

## 5. Canon Boundary: When $EDGE Becomes a Kernel Concern

Priority signaling becomes a Canon concern only when lack of participation in $EDGE results in:

- Loss of identity persistence
- Loss of interoperability
- Loss of practical observability

> **If a Holon without $EDGE can still persist, interoperate, and be observed, no Canon violation exists — regardless of economic concentration or discomfort.**
>
> **Concentration alone is not a violation. Contingency is.**

---

## 6. Failure Categories

### Category A — Acceptable Edge Failures

These do not threaten OASIS:

- $EDGE loses liquidity
- $EDGE adoption stagnates
- $EDGE is ignored by builders
- $EDGE is replaced by another edge token

*These are valid outcomes.*

### Category B — Contained System Failures

These require intervention but do not invalidate OASIS:

- Excessive concentration of $EDGE
- Priority dynamics disadvantaging newcomers
- Speculative misuse at the edge

*These are addressed through mechanism design, not Canon enforcement.*

### Category C — Architectural Failures

These invalidate $EDGE:

- Kernel identity becomes contingent on $EDGE
- Non-$EDGE Holons lose persistence or observability
- Reference tooling requires $EDGE by default
- Enforcement becomes economically captured

> **Category C failures require suspension or retirement.**

---

## 7. Enforcement & Stewardship (Summary)

$EDGE is subject to the Canon Enforcement & Stewardship Protocol v0.1.

Key properties:

- Enforcement is non-token-weighted
- Authority derives from legitimacy, not economics
- Actions operate through tooling, guidance, and disclosure
- Sunset clause: mandatory re-ratification within 18 months

> **If enforcement fails, the protocol — and $EDGE — are considered compromised.**

---

## 8. Suspension & Retirement

**Suspension** means withdrawal of Canon-aligned endorsement and reference support:

- Deprecation in reference tooling
- Removal from recommended coordination paths
- Public guidance against usage

*Suspension does not disable third-party systems.*

### Retirement

If retired due to architectural failure:

- $EDGE may become economically worthless
- No preservation of value is implied
- No claims exist against OASIS

> **This outcome is acceptable by design.**

---

## 9. Multi-Token Reality

**$EDGE is not the token of OASIS. It is the first tokenized incentive layer.**

Other edge tokens may exist:

- For different communities
- For different coordination problems
- For different temporal scopes

**The kernel remains token-agnostic.**

---

## 10. What $EDGE Cannot Guarantee

$EDGE cannot guarantee:

- Fair outcomes
- Equal participation
- Resistance to capital concentration
- Long-term legitimacy
- Market stability

> **It can only guarantee containment of failure.**

---

## 11. Design Principle (Load-Bearing)

> **If an incentive system cannot fail safely, it should not exist.**
>
> **$EDGE exists to test this principle under real economic pressure.**

---

## 12. Status

This document defines the architectural constraints of $EDGE.

*Token supply, decay, sinks, and cycle parameters are intentionally deferred and must be designed within these constraints.*

---

# Appendices

## Appendix A — Failure-Mode Disclosures (Summary)

- $EDGE may fail economically without consequence
- $EDGE may be suspended or retired
- Holders assume full risk
- No implied ownership, governance, or entitlement exists

## Appendix B — Canon Enforcement Triggers (Extract)

A violation claim is valid when:

- Identity persistence becomes economically contingent
- Interoperability requires $EDGE participation
- Observability degrades for non-$EDGE Holons

*Claims may be raised by any participant. Evaluations are issued by the Canon Stewardship Council.*

## Appendix C — Priority Signaling Worked Example

> **Required Next Doc**
>
> A concrete, numerical example demonstrating:
> - Two eligible proposals
> - Different $EDGE backing
> - Ordering mechanics
> - The precise point where priority becomes access gating
> - Correct remediation paths
>
> *This appendix is mandatory before parameter finalization.*

## Appendix D — Sunset Clause (Extract)

Regardless of conditions, the $EDGE framework and its enforcement model must be re-ratified or replaced within 18 months of adoption.

**Failure to do so constitutes expiration.**

---

# Final Statement

> **$EDGE does not exist to make OASIS successful. It exists to test whether economic coordination can coexist with identity neutrality.**
>
> **If it cannot, $EDGE should end — and OASIS should continue.**
>
> **That is the design.**
