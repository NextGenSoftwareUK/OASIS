# OASIS Cycle Protocol (v0)

> **Status:** Binding  
> **Applies to:** Kernel only  
> **Purpose:** Prevent permanent provisionality and force explicit evaluation of core claims

---

## 1. Purpose of a Cycle

A cycle is the smallest unit of accountable progress in OASIS.

Its function is not delivery, growth, or adoption. Its function is evaluation.

Each cycle exists to answer one question:

> Does the Holon-based kernel still hold under the pressures introduced during this period?

> **If this question cannot be answered, the cycle has failed.**

---

## 2. Definition of a Cycle

A cycle is defined by three properties, all required:

### 1. Bounded Timeframe

- Default: 8–12 weeks
- Must be declared at cycle start

### 2. Bounded Scope

Explicit statement of:

- what kernel assumptions are being stressed
- what is explicitly out of scope

### 3. Mandatory Artifacts

No cycle can close without producing the required outputs.

> **A cycle ends only when artifacts are published.**

---

## 3. What a Cycle Is Not

A cycle is not:

- a roadmap phase
- a sprint
- a funding milestone
- a release window
- a growth target

> **If a cycle is treated as any of the above, it is invalid.**

---

## 4. Required Artifacts (Non-Negotiable)

Each cycle must produce all of the following.

### 4.1 Kernel Evaluation Report

A written assessment answering, at minimum:

- Which invariants were stressed?
- Did any invariant weaken or fail?
- Were any violations discovered?
- What evidence supports the assessment?

> **This report must include at least one negative finding, even if minor. If no weaknesses are found, the evaluation is considered insufficient.**

### 4.2 Dissent & Disagreement Record

A public record of:

- disagreements about kernel interpretation
- unresolved questions
- minority positions

**Rules:**

- Dissent must be preserved verbatim
- Dissent may not be summarized away
- Resolution is optional; visibility is not

> **Agreement is not required for closure. Documentation is.**

### 4.3 Failure Condition Assessment

An explicit review of the kernel failure conditions, stating:

- Which conditions were approached
- Which remain distant
- Whether any threshold was crossed

> **If a failure condition is triggered: the cycle must recommend halt, revision, or abandonment. Deferral is not permitted.**

### 4.4 Artifact Index

A list of all experiments, diagrams, documents, implementations, and decisions that interacted with the kernel during the cycle.

> **Nothing touching the kernel may remain undocumented.**

---

## 5. What May Occur During a Cycle

**Allowed:**

- experiments, prototypes, adversarial tests
- edge collaborations
- failures, forks, partial implementations

**Encouraged:**

- stress, disagreement, ambiguity
- edge pressure on kernel assumptions

---

## 6. What May Not Occur During a Cycle

**Forbidden:**

- silent kernel changes
- retroactive justification
- redefining invariants to fit outcomes
- hiding failure behind future intent
- declaring success without evaluation

> **If kernel semantics are changed during a cycle: the change must be marked as provisional and explicitly evaluated in the same cycle.**

---

## 7. Cycle Start Requirements

Before a cycle begins, the following must be declared:

1. Cycle duration
2. Cycle scope
3. Assumptions under test
4. Named stewards responsible for evaluation (not outcomes)

> **If any are missing, the cycle cannot begin.**

---

## 8. Cycle End Conditions

A cycle ends only when:

- all required artifacts are published
- dissent is recorded
- failure conditions are assessed

> **Time expiration alone does not end a cycle. An unfinished cycle is a failed cycle.**

---

## 9. Accumulation Rules

- Unresolved kernel questions may carry forward
- Unexamined kernel violations may not
- Deferred evaluation counts as failure

> **Repeated deferral of the same issue across cycles is itself a kernel risk and must be noted as such.**

---

## 10. Relationship to the Edge

Edge activity may:

- move faster
- take risks
- ignore cycles

The kernel may not.

Edge success does not validate the kernel. Edge failure does not invalidate it.

> **Only cycles do.**

---

## 11. Cycle Failure

A cycle is considered failed if:

- required artifacts are missing
- evaluation is evasive or incomplete
- dissent is suppressed
- failure conditions are ignored

> **A failed cycle must be explicitly marked as such. Failure must be visible.**

---

## 12. Closing Constraint

The Cycle Protocol exists to ensure that OASIS remains:

- falsifiable
- inspectable
- interruptible

> Progress without evaluation is drift. Drift is capture.
