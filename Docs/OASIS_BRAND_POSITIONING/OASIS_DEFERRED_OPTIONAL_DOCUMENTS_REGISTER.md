# OASIS — Deferred & Optional Documents Register

> **Status:** Non-binding  
> **Purpose:** Identify future documents that may be introduced if and when conditions require them  
> **Principle:** No document exists by default; each must earn its necessity

> **This register does not authorize creation. It records possibility, not intent.**

---

## 1. Principle of Deferred Formalization

OASIS resists premature completeness.

Documents are introduced only when:

- ambiguity creates real harm,
- decisions become inconsistent,
- or pressure accumulates at a boundary.

> **The absence of a document is not a gap by default. It is often a feature.**

## 2. Categories of Deferred Documents

### A. Edge-Facing Documents

Concerned with experimentation, use, and application. These documents should only exist once edge activity meaningfully increases.

#### 2.1 Edge Playbook

**Purpose:** Describe how experiments, applications, and collaborations can engage OASIS without contaminating the kernel.

**Risk if introduced too early:** Encourages optimization before understanding.

#### 2.2 Economic Surfaces Memo

**Purpose:** Define where economic activity may safely interact with OASIS (tooling, services, experiments) and where it must not (identity, invariants, reconciliation).

**Trigger condition:** Repeated economic pressure on kernel decisions.

#### 2.3 Token Interaction Guidelines

**Purpose:** Clarify how tokens, markets, or financial primitives may exist at the edge without implying kernel endorsement or dependence.

**Note:** This is not a token spec and does not imply one will exist.

### B. Governance & Human Coordination

Concerned with people, power, and legitimacy. These documents should emerge only when stewardship strain becomes visible.

#### 2.4 Stewardship Succession Mechanism

**Purpose:** Define how stewardship transitions once replacement becomes necessary.

**Trigger condition:** Repeated invocation of stewardship replacement triggers.

#### 2.5 Dispute Escalation & Arbitration Memo

**Purpose:** Describe how deep, persistent disagreements are handled without granting final authority.

**Constraint:** Must preserve dissent; may not enforce convergence.

#### 2.6 Institutional Interface Note

**Purpose:** Clarify how institutions (companies, foundations, governments) may engage with OASIS without capture.

**Trigger condition:** Material institutional adoption or dependency.

### C. Technical Deepening

Concerned with formal rigor and adversarial clarity. These documents increase precision but also commitment.

#### 2.7 Formal Holon Semantics (Extended)

**Purpose:** Mathematical or formal specification of Holon behavior, identity, and constraints.

**Risk:** Over-specification that limits discovery.

#### 2.8 Adversarial Scenarios Compendium

**Purpose:** Catalogue failure modes, attacks, edge cases, and stress tests discovered over cycles.

**Trigger condition:** Repeated recurrence of similar failure patterns.

#### 2.9 Reconciliation Strategy Registry

**Purpose:** Document known reconciliation strategies used at the edge, without endorsing them.

**Constraint:** Registry, not recommendation.

### D. Archival & Continuity

Concerned with memory, history, and failure. These documents only matter once history exists.

#### 2.10 Canonical Archive Policy

**Purpose:** Define what is preserved, versioned, and remembered across cycles and potential failure.

#### 2.11 Failure & Post-Mortem Archive

**Purpose:** Specify how OASIS records its own failure if halt conditions are met.

**Note:** This document exists to ensure failure leaves knowledge behind.

## 3. Introduction Rules

Any deferred document must:

- state why it is now necessary,
- identify which ambiguity it resolves,
- name the risks it introduces,
- and declare whether it is binding or advisory.

> **No document may quietly graduate from optional to required.**

---

## 4. Closing Constraint

This register exists to resist document sprawl, not encourage it.

If OASIS ever becomes documentation-heavy without increased clarity, it is drifting.

> Documentation is a tool. Constraint is the goal.
