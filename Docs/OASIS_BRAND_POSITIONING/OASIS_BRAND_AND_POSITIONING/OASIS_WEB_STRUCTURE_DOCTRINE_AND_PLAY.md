# OASIS Web Structure: Doctrine and Play

# The Core Insight

There are three different modes of engagement, and they must not collapse:

1. **Understanding** → "What is OASIS really?"
2. **Constraint** → "What must not be broken?"
3. **Play** → "What can I try, break, build, or abandon?"

> **Most projects collapse (2) and (3). OASIS must keep them adjacent but separate.**

# Three Surfaces, Not Two

## Surface A — The Canon (Doctrine Surface)

**Audience:** Readers, skeptics, stewards

**Function:** Legitimacy, constraint, seriousness

This is what you already defined: Manifesto, Kernel Spec, Cycle Protocol, Stewardship Charter, Doctrine, Decision Checklist

> **Rule:** Nothing here is "tryable." Nothing here is "beta."

## Surface B — The Playground (Edge Surface)

**Audience:** Builders, tinkerers, artists, researchers

**Function:** Exploration without endorsement

This is where tech lives — explicitly framed as edge.

## Surface C — The Bridge (Orientation Surface)

**Audience:** First-time visitors

**Function:** Help people choose the right mode

This surface routes people away from confusion.

# How This Looks in Practice

## 1. Main Website = The Bridge

**Navigation:** What OASIS Is • The Holon • Architecture • Canon • Playground • Status

> **Doctrine and play are visible side by side, not merged.**

## 2. Canon Section (Doctrine Surface)

Exactly as already designed.

Add one line everywhere:

> This section defines constraints. It does not promise tools, adoption, or usability.

This protects you legally, ethically, and philosophically.

## 3. Playground Section (Edge Surface)

This is where your tech lives — but with explicit framing.

**Entry Page:** "The Playground"

**Tone:** Inviting, non-promissory, experimental.

**Key language:**

- "These tools exist to test assumptions, not deliver solutions."
- "Failure here is expected."
- "Nothing here defines the kernel."

### Playground Substructure

#### A. Experiments

Concrete things people can touch.

**Examples:** Holon Explorer, Identity Sandbox, Reconciliation Simulator, Multi-provider persistence demo

Each experiment card includes:

- What assumption it stresses
- Which invariant it touches
- Known failure modes
- What not to infer from success

> **This is powerful.**

#### B. SDKs & Tooling

This is where builders actually build.

**Structure:** SDK (clearly marked "Edge Tooling"), CLI, APIs, Visualizers, Reference implementations

> **Critical label on every page:** This tooling does not define OASIS. It is one possible expression of the edge.

#### C. Build Something (Explicitly Not "Build on OASIS")

Language matters.

**Use:** "Experiment with", "Stress-test", "Prototype around", "Explore with"

**Avoid:** "Powered by", "Built on", "Native to"

#### D. Showcase (Careful)

If you showcase projects:

- Frame them as examples, not endorsements
- Always include: What kernel assumption they test, What they do not prove

## 4. Documentation Site (Deep Tech)

Here's where the long technical texts live: Holonic Architecture Overview, HyperDrive internals, Provider abstraction, Code examples

Docs must clearly label:

- Kernel-relevant vs edge-only material
- Stable vs experimental components

---

# A Crucial Rule: Direction of Authority

- **Canon →** constrains Playground
- **Playground →** may challenge Canon
- **Playground** never defines Canon

> **Make this explicit in copy.**

---

# What This Achieves

- Builders get something real to touch
- Philosophical integrity is preserved
- Success doesn't corrupt the kernel
- Failure doesn't delegitimize the project
- Skeptics can audit without running demos
- Play doesn't pretend to be proof

> **This is extremely rare — and extremely powerful.**
