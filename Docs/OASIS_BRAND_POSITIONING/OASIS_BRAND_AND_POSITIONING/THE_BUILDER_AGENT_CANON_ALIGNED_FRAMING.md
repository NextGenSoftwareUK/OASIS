# The Builder Agent — Canon-Aligned Framing

# First: What This Agent Is

This agent is:

- an edge tool
- a thinking companion
- a project-shaping instrument
- a translation layer between intent and structure

It helps builders:

- clarify ideas, scaffold systems, reason about architecture
- explore Holon-based patterns
- generate starter code or specs

It does not:

- define the kernel, enforce invariants, certify correctness, speak with authority on OASIS doctrine

> **That distinction must be explicit everywhere.**

---

# Where It Lives (Important)

**On the Website:** Playground → Builder Agent

Not under Canon. Not under Architecture. Not under "Core."

**Label:** Builder Agent (Experimental)

**Sub-label:** An edge tool for exploration, not an authority.

---

# Two Versions of the Agent (Clean Split)

## 1. Public Query Agent (On the Site)

**Purpose:** Orientation + exploration.

**Capabilities:**

- Answer questions about OASIS concepts
- Help users think through ideas
- Suggest patterns, not prescriptions
- Route users to: docs, playground tools, experiments

**Hard constraints (must be enforced):**

- Cannot declare anything "correct"
- Cannot resolve doctrine disputes
- Must cite Canon when relevant
- Must surface uncertainty

> **Language guardrail (example):** "This is one possible interpretation. The Canon is authoritative."

> **This agent is a guide, not a judge.**

## 2. Builder Agent (Local / Cursor-Based)

**Purpose:** Hands-on creation. This is what serious builders will actually use.

**How it's framed:**

- "Bring your project into your editor."
- "Use this agent to scaffold, explore, and stress-test ideas."
- "This agent reflects one interpretation of OASIS — you are expected to modify it."

**Distribution model:** Prompt pack, Agent config, Optional starter repo, Cursor instructions

> **Critical framing sentence (use verbatim):** This agent is not part of the kernel. It is an edge expression designed to be forked, broken, and replaced.

# What the Builder Agent Can Do Well

## Capabilities (Encouraged)

- Help design Holon hierarchies
- Suggest parent-child structures
- Scaffold APIs or schemas
- Generate example code
- Map ideas to edge architectures
- Ask uncomfortable questions: "What breaks if this provider disappears?", "What part of this is identity vs commitment?"

> **This is powerful and aligned.**

## Capabilities (Explicitly Forbidden)

The agent must not:

- assert kernel truths
- declare compliance
- certify invariants
- imply endorsement
- collapse edge success into kernel validation

> **If it starts doing that, it becomes a gatekeeper — which violates the Canon.**

---

# How You Introduce This Publicly (Copy Guidance)

## On the Playground page:

> **Builder Agent**
>
> An experimental agent designed to help you think, prototype, and explore projects around OASIS. It reflects one possible interpretation of the edge — not the kernel itself. You are expected to question it, fork it, and break it.

## On the Agent Interface Itself (UI copy):

> This agent operates at the edge. It may be wrong. It does not speak for the Canon.

> **That line alone protects you enormously.**

---

# How This Scales Safely

Later, you can have:

- multiple builder agents
- competing interpretations
- community-maintained agents
- specialized agents (tokenomics, agents, infra, art)

> **That's good. Multiple agents arguing is healthier than one agent being "official."**

---

# One Final Structural Insight

Think of the agent as:

> A Holon that helps you design other Holons — without claiming to define them.

> **That symmetry matters.**
