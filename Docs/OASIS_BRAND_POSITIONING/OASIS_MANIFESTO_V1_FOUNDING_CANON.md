# OASIS Manifesto v1 — Founding Canon

---

## Binding Scope

The Founding Canon is binding on:

- architectural decisions at the kernel level
- brand and narrative positioning
- governance and stewardship design
- economic and token-related decisions
- partnerships and integrations
- visual systems representing the OASIS ecosystem

Any proposal that conflicts with the principles stated herein must either:

1. be rejected, or
2. explicitly justify why the Canon no longer holds — in which case the project itself must be reevaluated.

> **Status:** Frozen  
> **Effective date:** January 2026  
> **Revision policy:** Locked until completion of the next formal evaluation cycle

## Canon Declaration

This document is hereby designated as the Founding Canon of OASIS. It establishes the first principles, philosophical commitments, and structural constraints of the project. It is not a roadmap, not a product specification, and not a marketing document. It exists to define what OASIS is and, more importantly, what it refuses to become.

The Manifesto is intentionally restrained. Its authority derives not from scope or ambition, but from the limits it imposes.

---

## Revision Policy

This document is frozen. It may not be amended, expanded, or reinterpreted reactively in response to:

- market pressure
- partnership requirements
- funding considerations
- implementation convenience
- adoption metrics

Revisions, if any, may occur only:

- after a defined evaluation cycle concludes, and
- with an explicit record of what claims held, what failed, and why.

Until such a cycle is completed, the Canon stands as written.

---

## Role of the Canon

The Founding Canon serves as:

- a reference point in moments of disagreement
- a constraint against scope creep
- a guardrail against accidental authority
- a reminder that OASIS prioritizes correctness over momentum

When decisions become difficult, the Canon is consulted first. If adherence to the Canon prevents progress, that outcome is considered valid evidence — not an obstacle to be worked around.

---

## Closing Statement

> OASIS does not expand by loosening its core. It expands by allowing everything else to orbit it.

The Holon remains central. The kernel remains neutral. The edge remains free.

This document stands until reality proves it wrong.
