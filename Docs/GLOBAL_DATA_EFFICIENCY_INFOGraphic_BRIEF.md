**Glif Prompt**:
```
Infographic title frame showing global data crisis. Large headline "120 Zettabytes of Data" in bold. Subheadline "Growing 45-50% annually | 30-60% is waste". Visual: Globe with data streams flowing around it, exponential growth curve overlay, crisis indicators "Supply constraints", "Rising costs", "Environmental impact" as warning icons. Bottom text "Holonic Architecture: The Solution" in contrasting color. Modern, impactful design with blue/purple gradient and red warning accents.
```

**Technical Annotation**: 
- "2024: 120 zettabytes stored globally"
- "2025 projection: 175-180 zettabytes"
- "30-60% duplication and waste"

**Text Box Content**:
```
The world now stores 120 zettabytes of data, growing at 45-50% annually, yet 30-60% of this data is waste—duplicated, redundant, or obsolete. Holonic architecture eliminates this inefficiency, reducing storage requirements by up to 90% while maintaining full data accessibility.
```

## Frame 2: The Duplication Problem
**Frame Title**: "The Waste: 30-60% of All Data is Redundant"

**Visual Description**:
- Pie chart or donut chart showing data breakdown
- **Slices**:
  - Unique data: 10% (small, green)
  - Duplicated data: 40% (large, red)
  - ROT data: 30% (large, orange)
  - Copy data: 20% (medium, yellow)
- Callouts: "Only 10% is unique", "90% is waste"
- Visual: Show duplication multiplying data

**Glif Prompt**:
```
Pie chart showing global data waste. Slices: Unique data 10% (small, green), Duplicated data 40% (large, red), ROT data 30% (large, orange), Copy data 20% (medium, yellow). Callouts: "Only 10% is unique" pointing to green slice, "90% is waste" pointing to red/orange/yellow slices. Visual elements showing data duplication multiplying. Text: "30-60% of all enterprise data is redundant, obsolete, or trivial". Modern, data visualization style.
```

**Technical Annotation**:
- "Unique data: 12 zettabytes (10%)"
- "Waste: 108 zettabytes (90%)"
- "60% consumed by copy data alone"

**Text Box Content**:
```
Only 10% of stored data is unique business-critical information, while the remaining 90% consists of duplicated copies, redundant records, and obsolete files. This massive waste multiplies storage costs and compute requirements without adding any business value.
```

- **Holonic** (right, green):
  - Small storage icon: "1.1 units stored"
  - Breakdown: "1 unit unique + 0.1 units overhead"
  - Formula: "Unique Data × 1.1"
- Efficiency callout: "9x more efficient"
- Visual: Show massive size difference

**Glif Prompt**:
```
Side-by-side storage comparison. Left "Conventional" (red, large): Storage icon showing "10 units stored", breakdown "1 unit unique + 9 units waste", formula "Unique Data × 10". Right "Holonic" (green, small): Storage icon showing "1.1 units stored", breakdown "1 unit unique + 0.1 units overhead", formula "Unique Data × 1.1". Efficiency callout "9x more efficient" between them. Visual showing massive size difference. Modern, technical comparison design.
```

**Technical Annotation**:
- "Conventional: 10x storage (duplication + overhead)"
- "Holonic: 1.1x storage (unique + minimal overhead)"
- "Efficiency ratio: 9.09x"

**Text Box Content**:
```
Conventional systems store 10 units for every 1 unit of unique data due to duplication and overhead, while holonic architecture stores just 1.1 units by eliminating redundancy and using shared parent-child relationships. This represents a 9x improvement in storage efficiency.
```

**Glif Prompt**:
```
Bar chart showing global storage reduction. X-axis: Adoption scenarios (0% Current, 50% Adoption, 80% Adoption). Y-axis: Storage in zettabytes (0-120). Bars: Current 120 ZB (tall, red), 50% adoption 88 ZB (medium, yellow), 80% adoption 69 ZB (short, green).

- "50% adoption: 88 zettabytes (32 ZB saved)"
- "80% adoption: 69 zettabytes (51 ZB saved)"

**Text Box Content**:
```
If 50% of enterprises adopted holonic architecture, global storage would drop from 120 to 88 zettabytes, saving 32 zettabytes. At 80% adoption, we could reduce global storage by 43%, eliminating 51 zettabytes of redundant data.
```

Reduction percentages "10% (50% adoption)", "35% (80% adoption)" visible. Modern, technical comparison.
```

**Technical Annotation**:
- "Conventional: 180 ZB equivalent compute"
- "Holonic: 12.6 ZB equivalent compute"
- "Efficiency: 14.3x"

**Text Box Content**:
```
Conventional systems require 180 zettabytes of compute equivalent because they process duplicated data multiple times and manage exponential connection complexity, while holonic architecture needs only 12.6 zettabytes by processing unique data once. This 14x efficiency gain translates to 10-35% global compute reduction depending on adoption rates.
```
