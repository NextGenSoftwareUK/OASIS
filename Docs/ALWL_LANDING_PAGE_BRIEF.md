# A Lot With Little — Featured Partner Landing Page Brief

**Purpose:** Brief for the new landing page that introduces the A Lot With Little Family / Legacy programme (Featured Partner offering). For use by designers, developers, and copywriters.

**Source:** Derived from [ALWL_FOUNDATION_MONETISATION_OUTLINE.md](./ALWL_FOUNDATION_MONETISATION_OUTLINE.md) (sections 1–4, 2.3).

---

## 1. Page goal

- Explain the **Foundation** and the **Family** (or **Legacy**) in one place.
- Show **who it’s for**, **what they get**, and **how to express interest**.
- Do **not** show price on the page — “on request” or “following a conversation” only.
- Convey **selection** and **partnership**, not “buy your way in.”

**Audience:** Property developers and place-makers (or development groups / family offices) who share the “a lot with little” ethos and are considering becoming Featured Partners.

---

## 2. Suggested URL

- `alotwithlittle.com/family` or `alotwithlittle.com/legacy` (or `/foundation` if the page doubles as Foundation intro).
- Must sit clearly under the main ALWL site (same nav, footer, visual language).

---

## 3. Section-by-section content

### 3.1 Hero

- **Headline:** e.g. “Join the A Lot With Little Family.” (Or “Become part of the Legacy” if using Legacy.)
- **Subhead:** Visionary developers, shared ethos, limited places, global exhibition access.
- **Optional line:** One sentence naming the tour — e.g. “The exhibition has been shown at the Venice Biennale, the AA London, DAZ Berlin, TU Delft, and more.”
- **CTA:** “Express interest” or “Request a conversation” (scrolls to or links to Contact / Apply).

### 3.2 Why the Foundation & the Family

- Short paragraph: ALWL’s mission (sustainable, context-driven architecture; “a lot with little”).
- The **Foundation** extends that mission (grants, education, community).
- The **Family** (or **Legacy**) is how selected developers and their projects become part of the story — featured on the tour, in film, and in the ALWL network.
- Tone: partnership and selection, not sales.

### 3.3 Who it’s for

- Property developers and place-makers who care about sustainability, context, and social impact.
- One line: “If you build with the same ethos we exhibit, we’d like to hear from you.”
- Optional: “A limited number of places are available each cycle.”

### 3.4 What Featured Partner membership includes

- **Five core perks**, each as a short card or bullet:
  1. **ALWL Spotlight Film** — Documentary on the founder’s vision, project history, heritage of the place, and future plans. ALWL-quality storytelling; usable for the developer’s own channels and at exhibitions.
  2. **Featured access at global exhibitions** — Project (and optionally the film) featured at ALWL partner exhibitions and galleries. “Stand alongside the work of ALWL architects.” **Prominent:** Show the exhibition tour here — see §3.6 and the tour list below.
  3. **PR package** — Press, media angles, social content, aligned with the tour timeline so the developer’s story is part of the tour narrative.
  4. **ALWL style book** — Printed and/or digital monograph on the project in ALWL design language; lasting artefact and credential.
  5. **Founder roundtable with ALWL architects** — Exclusive roundtable (in-person or hybrid) around the exhibition; “Meet the minds behind the exhibition.” Includes a **Family photo** (or Legacy portrait) with the architects and partners.
- Optional: One line on “Supporting the Foundation” (e.g. part of the fee or a separate donation supports grants/education).

### 3.5 How it works

- **Step 1:** Expression of interest / short application (form on this page).
- **Step 2:** Conversation with the ALWL team.
- **Step 3:** Selection and agreement.
- **Step 4:** Onboarding and production (film, style book, PR planning).
- **Step 5:** Featured presence on the tour and at the roundtable.

(After the first call, ALWL may send a Post–Discovery Call questionnaire to refine fit before a formal proposal.)

### 3.6 The ALWL exhibition tour (prominent)

- **Requirement:** This section must be visible and credible — it proves the tour is real and global.
- **Headline:** e.g. “The tour” or “Where we’ve been.”
- **Copy line:** “A Lot With Little has been shown at the Venice Biennale, the Architectural Association London, DAZ Berlin, TU Delft, Irish Architecture Foundation, Guangdong Museum of Art, ZAZ Zurich, CAMP Prague, and MAS Context Chicago — and the tour continues. As a Featured Partner, your project joins this circuit.”
- **Full list** (use as table or simple list; mark current when relevant):

### 3.7 Contact / Apply

- **CTA:** “Express interest” or “Request a conversation.”
- **Form fields (minimum):** Name, Email, Organisation, Project summary (short), Why ALWL / ethos fit (short).
- Optional: “A limited number of places are available for [current year/cycle].”
- No price on the page; next step is a call, then (if relevant) questionnaire, then proposal.

---

## 4. Tone and design

- **Tone:** Thoughtful, architectural, minimal. Partnership and selection, not “buy your way in.”
- **Design:** Match the main ALWL site — clean, considered, plenty of space. No clutter.
- **Optional:** One or two short quotes from Noemi Blager or an ALWL-featured architect about “who we want in the Family” (or Legacy).

---

## 5. Naming note

- The outline supports two programme names: **Family** (warm, belonging) or **Legacy** (gravitas, lasting impact). Choose one for the page and use it consistently; the roundtable photo can still be called “Family photo” or “Legacy portrait.”

---

## 6. Out of scope for this brief

- Pricing (not on the page).
- Post–Discovery Call questionnaire (sent after first call; see outline §8).
- Foundation standalone page or ALWL Community page (can be linked from here).
