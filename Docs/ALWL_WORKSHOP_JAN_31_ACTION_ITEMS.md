# A Lot With Little — Workshop Follow-Up (31 January)

**Meeting:** Impromptu Google Meet, 31 January  
**Recording:** [Fathom — 51 mins](https://fathom.video/share/ABPbGGFyqXxU5qFF3UrsvUeovTeDstp5) (no highlights)  
**Purpose:** Structure ALWL as a platform for credibility and legacy; monetisation via Foundation + Family; first client (Valerio) and landing page.

## 1. Decisions and agreements

### Structure

- **Foundation:** Non-profit / mission vehicle. Grants, research, education, disaster-relief alignment. **Community lives here** — sustainability-minded builders and architects, plug into universities and institutions; position ALWL thought leaders.
- **Family:** Membership and partnership vehicle. Visionary developers “join” and get featured. **Revenue and paid “slots” live here.** Name: “Family” preferred (close, mutually supportive); “Community” is too broad for paying partners (community = students; this is elevated). Not “movement” for the paying tier — movement is the broader decentralised idea.
- **Language:** Use “Featured Partner,” “ALWL ethos / criteria / values” (not “tradition” for this — tradition implies past; ALWL is evolving). “We’re not selling anything” — partnership and selection. Keep the line about “partnership and selection, not a transaction” on the landing page.

### Positioning and focus

- **Target:** Wealthy developers with aligned values; motivation = legacy, PR, access to ALWL circles. For now, **focus on one “big fish”** — tailor everything so Valerio feels part of something intimate and elevated. **Max 4 partners per year** at this stage; we’re not opening to institutions or the general public yet.
- **Geography:** Latin America / South America focus is a strength (authenticity, pride). Americans look in and want to be part of it. No need to “go to America” — connect into the leading institutions in South America.
- **Pricing:** Do **not** sell the package short. £120k–£150k (or equivalent) is the right band. The deliverables (film, book, PR, roundtable, exhibition feature) are premium. If the number is too low, it signals “take this less seriously.” Price stays as discussed; willingness to pay is part of the pilot with Valerio.

### Website and visibility

- **ALWL site must feel current.** “Current” vs “past” events/exhibitions need to be clear. Host institutions (e.g. CAMP, Fathom) should be asked to keep their ALWL pages updated so the tour has “traffic” and looks active — this supports the credibility story.
- **Family page:** Create a **new page** for the Family / Featured Partner offering. **Do not add it to the main navigation** (no “Family” button in the header). Page exists, is **unlinked** — you send the link by email to selected people (e.g. Valerio). Reason: if “Family” is in the nav, every architect who wants to be part of the next exhibition will contact; this offering is for paying Featured Partners only. You can still share the link with people “involved” in ALWL when it helps move them forward.
- **Noemi’s profile:** The landing page (and any one-pager) should **feature Noemi Blager** clearly — founder, curator. Her profile and presence are important for credibility.

### Deliverables and accountability

- **Spotlight Film:** Tapio does the film (founder vision, project history, heritage, future plans). Keep relationships with architects and partners open even when they’re not paying — they are the “product” and the story.
- **Roundtable:** E.g. roundtable in Florianopolis with Solano, Valerio — Noemi can organise this; Solano is willing. Regional delivery (South America) is fine and reinforces authenticity.
- **What’s in your control:** Be clear with Valerio what you can commit to (e.g. roundtable in region, Tapio for film, style book, PR coordination). If travel or costs are part of delivery (e.g. Noemi flying to meet him), decide whether that comes from the partnership fee and state it simply: “You’re in the family now; we’re going to make amazing things happen together.”

### Community and team

- **Community:** Online community for sustainability-minded builders and architects — discuss projects, connect with ALWL team and exhibition. Lasting place for the “a lot with little” idea to live and exchange. **Intern → Community Manager:** Hire someone (e.g. from an architectural school); Fathom (Czech organisation that hosted ALWL and did the publication with equivalent projects) could help find a good person. UK or elsewhere is up to you; speak to Pav (or relevant contact) if needed. For a student, ALWL is a strong opportunity.
- **Team:** ALWL needs to be seen as having a **team**, not just Noemi — and ideally **young people, young visionaries**. Building that (intern, community, eventual roles) supports the platform story.

### Other prospects

- **Valerio:** Entire offer and landing page are tailored for him first. One clear, punchy number and “we’re handling it for you.”
- **Other companies (e.g. Chaos):** Different profile (large, international). A separate, adapted pitch can be sent later (e.g. “what I’m planning to send them”). Don’t dilute the Valerio-focused message in the first send.
- **Fundraising:** Foundation can take donations (e.g. Holcim Foundation, ARCA). That’s a later step once the structure is set.

## 2. Action items

| # | Action | Owner | Notes |
|---|--------|--------|------|
| 1 | **Landing page (first version)** — Update ALWL site with a new, unlinked page for the Family / Featured Partner offering. Same visual language as ALWL (logos, type). Include: why Foundation & Family, who it’s for, what membership includes (five perks), how it works, exhibition tour list, Noemi’s profile, express-interest form or CTA. Do **not** add “Family” to main nav. | Max | Max to do first version; can send to Noemi for review. Noemi has website access and design assets. |
| 2 | **Typeform (application / expression of interest)** — Create an ALWL-branded Typeform. Shorter form for now (not every question from the full outline). E.g.: what drives your practice; how it aligns with ALWL ethos; success for your project in 3–5 years; where you work; organisation basics. 10–15 min, confidential. Link from landing page or send after first contact. | Noemi | Noemi has Typeform; use ALWL fonts/branding. |
| 3 | **Send Family page link to Valerio** — When the page and (if used) form are ready, send the **link by email** only. No public launch yet. Tailor the message so he feels invited into something intimate and elevated. | Noemi | Don’t send until page (and optional form) are ready. Consider including Tapio in a follow-up conversation when relevant. |
| 4 | **Ask host institutions to refresh ALWL content** — Contact CAMP, Fathom, and other recent hosts: ask them to keep their ALWL exhibition/event pages updated (e.g. “current” vs “past”) so the tour looks active and drives “traffic” to the ALWL story. | Noemi | Supports credibility and “something happening now.” |
| 5 | **Intern / Community Manager** — Decide to hire an intern (architectural school) to develop and moderate the ALWL community. Reach out to Fathom (and any other suitable org) to ask if they can help find a candidate. Define: role, platform (e.g. Discord or similar), and how it ties to the Foundation. | Noemi | Community sits under Foundation; intern can grow into community manager. |
| 6 | **Pricing and proposal for Valerio** — Keep the price in the agreed band (£120k–£150k or equivalent). One clear number, one clear package. Draft a short proposal or one-pager for him (deliverables, process, “you’re in the family now”) without under-selling. Decide what’s included (e.g. travel, roundtable location) and state it simply. | Noemi | Use outline and landing page as base; Max can help refine wording if needed. |
| 7 | **Digest deliverables and timeline** — Noemi to go through the full list of deliverables (film, style book, PR, roundtable, exhibition feature, family photo) and confirm what she can commit to and in what order. Share any constraints or dependencies (e.g. Tapio, Solano, host venues) so the proposal and timeline are realistic. | Noemi | “I have to digest and think very well of the deliverables.” |
| 8 | **Design polish (optional)** — If Max’s first version is “good enough to send,” use it. For a more polished look later, Noemi’s nephew (Switzerland) or another designer can align the Family page with ALWL’s full visual language. | Noemi | Priority: something sendable in the next few days; polish can follow. |
