# OASIS IDE: What You Can Do

**Date:** January 2026  
**Purpose:** Practical guide to OASIS IDE capabilities

---

## 🎯 The Big Picture

OASIS IDE is like **Cursor + VS Code**, but with **native OASIS superpowers** built-in. You can build interoperable applications (OAPPs) that work across all blockchains, platforms, and networks - all from one IDE.

---

## 🚀 What You Can Do (By Feature)

### 1. **Code Like Normal** (Everything Cursor/VS Code Can Do)

✅ **Write Code**
- Full Monaco editor (same as VS Code)
- Syntax highlighting for all languages
- IntelliSense code completion
- Multi-cursor editing
- Find/replace with regex
- Git integration

✅ **AI-Powered Coding**
- Chat with AI assistant
- Generate code from natural language
- Get code explanations
- Refactoring suggestions
- Bug detection

**Example:**
```
You: "Create a function that fetches user data from an API"
AI: [Generates complete function with error handling]
```

---

### 2. **Use OASIS Tools Without Configuration** (Native MCP)

✅ **100+ OASIS Tools Available by Default**
- No setup needed
- No configuration files
- Just use them in chat or code

**What You Can Do:**

#### **Avatar & Identity Management**
```
You: "Create an avatar for my app user"
IDE: ✅ Avatar created: user-abc123

You: "Get avatar details for username 'player1'"
IDE: ✅ Returns full avatar profile
```

#### **Blockchain Operations**
```
You: "Create a Solana wallet for avatar abc123"
IDE: ✅ Wallet created: 7xKXtg2CW87d97TXJSDpbD5jBkheTqA83TZRuJosgAsU

You: "Send 0.1 SOL from avatar1 to avatar2"
IDE: ✅ Transaction sent: signature-xyz...

You: "Get wallet balance for avatar abc123"
IDE: ✅ Balance: 5.5 SOL
```

#### **NFT Operations**
```
You: "Mint an NFT with title 'My Art' and image at https://example.com/art.png"
IDE: ✅ NFT minted! Mint address: abc123...

You: "Get all NFTs owned by avatar abc123"
IDE: ✅ Returns list of NFTs

You: "Place this NFT at coordinates 51.5074, -0.1278 (London)"
IDE: ✅ GeoNFT placed! Players can now collect it in AR World
```

#### **Data Management (Holons)**
```
You: "Save user profile data as a holon"
IDE: ✅ Holon saved: holon-xyz789

You: "Search for holons with name 'UserProfile'"
IDE: ✅ Returns matching holons

You: "Share this holon with other OAPPs"
IDE: ✅ Holon made accessible
```

#### **Karma & Reputation**
```
You: "Award 50 karma to avatar abc123 for completing a quest"
IDE: ✅ Karma awarded! New total: 150

You: "Get karma stats for avatar abc123"
IDE: ✅ Returns karma breakdown and history
```

---

### 3. **Work with Agents** (A2A Protocol)

✅ **Discover Agents**
```
You: "Find agents that can mint NFTs"
IDE: ✅ Shows list of NFT minting agents

You: "Find agents for data analysis"
IDE: ✅ Shows data analysis agents
```

✅ **Invoke Agents**
```
You: "Use the NFT agent to create a collection of 10 NFTs"
IDE: [Discovers agent]
     [Invokes agent]
     [Agent uses MCP tools]
     ✅ Collection created! 10 NFTs minted

You: "Ask the smart contract agent to generate a token contract"
IDE: [Agent generates contract code]
     ✅ Contract generated and ready to deploy
```

✅ **Agent Collaboration**
```
You: "Use the code generation agent, then have the testing agent review it"
IDE: [Agent 1 generates code]
     [Agent 2 reviews and suggests improvements]
     ✅ Code ready with test coverage
```

---

### 4. **Build OAPPs Visually** (OAPP Builder)

✅ **Drag-and-Drop OAPP Creation**

2. Drag "NFT Reward" component
3. Connect them
4. Configure: "Complete mission → Award NFT"
5. Click "Generate OAPP"
6. ✅ OAPP created and deployed!
```

✅ **OAPP Templates**

- Deploy to multiple platforms (Web, Mobile, VR, AR)

---

### 5. **Mint NFTs Directly from IDE**

✅ **Visual NFT Minting**
- Upload image
- Fill metadata form
- Select blockchain (Solana, Ethereum, etc.)
- Preview before minting
- Batch minting support

**Example:**
```
1. Click "Mint NFT" in tools panel

IDE: ✅ Transaction sent! Signature: abc123...
```

---

### 7. **Create Missions & Quests** (STAR API)

✅ **Mission Builder**

**Example:**
```
You: "Create a mission called 'Explore the City' that rewards 100 karma"
IDE: ✅ Mission created! Players can now complete it
```

---

### 8. **Deploy Smart Contracts**

✅ **Contract Generation & Deployment**
- Generate contracts from descriptions
- Compile contracts

- Verify contracts

**Example:**
```
You: "Generate a Solana token contract with 1 billion supply"
IDE: [Generates contract code]
     [Compiles]
     [Deploys to Solana]
     ✅ Contract deployed at: abc123...
```

---

### 9. **Explore Holons** (Data Visualization)

✅ **Visual Data Exploration**
- See holon relationships
- View data structure
- Edit holons
- Share holons between apps

**Example:**
```
You: "Show me all holons in my project"

## 🚀 What This Enables

### **Before OASIS IDE:**
- Build app for one blockchain
- Build separate app for another blockchain
- Build separate app for Web
- Build separate app for Mobile
- **Result:** 4+ separate codebases

### **With OASIS IDE:**
- Build one OAPP
- Works on all blockchains
