# All-Hands Meeting Agenda
**Date:** January 23, 2025  
**Based on:** Impromptu Google Meet Discussion - January 22, 2025

---

## Meeting Objectives
1. Align on community building strategy before TGE
2. Launch "Build It With Oasis" initiative
3. Plan AMA series with leaderboard gamification
4. Integrate Hitchhiker's Guide partnership
5. Execute quick-win integrations (Hytopia, etc.)

---

## 1. Opening & Context (5 mins)
- **TGE Timeline Update**
  - Current status: 2 weeks (hoping to extend to 6 weeks)
  - Hitchhiker's release target: August
  - Community building is critical before both launches

- **Key Priority**: Building community of builders
  - Everything we prove now inherits into Hitchhiker's World
  - Focus on creating entry points for participation and membership

---

## 2. "Build It With Oasis" Initiative (15 mins)

### Concept
- Weekly show/AMA series featuring builders
- Theme: "Build It With Oasis"
- Format: Conversations about what people are building (OpenSERV, external projects)
- Goal: Show how to build easier with Oasis and Star Hall

### Action Items
- [ ] **Identify Host**
  - Reach out to PT (or similar ambassador with network)
  - Token allocation agreement ($5-10k or token-based)
  - Weekly commitment

- [ ] **Content Strategy**
  - Feature builders from OpenSERV ecosystem
  - Feature builders outside OpenSERV
  - Discuss integration opportunities with Oasis
  - Highlight Star Hall capabilities

- [ ] **Timeline**
  - Target: Start next week (if possible)
  - Frequency: Weekly (Friday suggested)
  - Duration: Flexible (30-60 mins)

### Discussion Points
- Who should host? (PT mentioned as example)
- Token allocation structure
- Content format and structure
- Integration with other initiatives

## 3. AMA Leaderboard & Gamification System (20 mins)

### The Concept: "Mysterious Leaderboard"
- **Phase 1 (Season 1)**: Mysterious tracking
  - Track avatar creation
  - Track AMA attendance
  - Track participation in ecosystem activities
  - Leaderboard shows "Redacted" or mysterious points
  - No explanation of scoring system
  - Creates "what the hell's happening" intrigue

- **Phase 2**: Big Reveal at TGE
  - Reveal: People were being rewarded for "telling stories"
  - Pure good faith reward distribution
  - Creates talkability and community excitement

### Technical Implementation

#### Option A: NFT-Based Collection System
- **Upgradeable NFTs** (we have this tech!)
  - Collectible NFTs given during/after each AMA
  - Password/word from show (last 5 minutes) to claim
  - Can be collected retroactively (listen back to get password)
  - "MacGuffin" style - collectible but purpose unclear
  - Most collected = top of leaderboard

#### Option B: Simple Tracking System
- Avatar creation tracking
- AMA attendance tracking
- Database-driven leaderboard
- Manual or semi-automated point allocation

### Live Tech Demo During AMAs
- **3-Minute NFT Creation Workflow**
  - Show: Prompt → AI Image → NFT minting
  - Audience suggestions for prompts
  - Live context integration
  - Demonstrates ease of building with Oasis
  - Creates collectible NFT from the show

### Action Items
- [ ] **Decide on Implementation Approach**
  - NFT-based vs. simple tracking
  - Automation level (speech-to-text? manual? co-app?)

- [ ] **Build Leaderboard System**
  - If NFT-based: Upgradeable NFT system
  - If simple: Database + frontend leaderboard
  - Timeline: "20 minutes" (Brendan's estimate) - verify feasibility

- [ ] **Create Collection Mechanism**
  - Password/word system for claiming NFTs
  - Co-app link during AMA
  - Retroactive collection support

- [ ] **Plan Season 1 Structure**
  - 4 AMAs between now and TGE (suggested)
  - Scoring system (keep mysterious)
  - Reward structure (token allocation at TGE)

### Discussion Points
- Can we automate speech-to-leaderboard? (AI solution?)
- NFT vs. simple tracking - which is faster to build?
- Budget for rewards (mentioned: $500-$10,000 or token promises)
- Season 2 structure (more clarity, include Hytopia, etc.)

---

## 4. Quick-Win Integrations (15 mins)

### Hytopia Integration (In Progress)
- **Status**: Idea from Cordy, already in motion

  - Easy integration for top creators
  - Real-time iteration via conversation

- **Action Items**
  - [ ] Continue development
  - [ ] Identify top Hytopia creators
  - [ ] Create integration guide

### "Bespoke Little Builds" Strategy
- **Concept**: Quick, free integrations for projects
  - Example: Free leaderboard for events (20 minutes to build)
  - "This is yours, come talk to us"
  - Door-kicking approach to partnerships

- **Action Items**
  - [ ] Identify 2-3 target projects
  - [ ] Create quick-build templates
  - [ ] Develop outreach strategy

## Key Principles from Discussion

1. **Time is the only resource we'll never get more of** - Don't waste community's time
2. **Build community of builders** - Everything inherits into Hitchhiker's
3. **Quick iterations** - 20-minute builds, 3-minute demos
4. **Good faith execution** - First reveal must be "pure good faith" for maximum impact
5. **Talkability** - Create things people will discuss (mysterious leaderboard, live demos)

---

## Notes from Transcript

- **Brendan's Experience**: Hundreds of Twitter spaces, understands value of consistent hosting
- **Max's Vision**: Community building is critical, everything connects to Hitchhiker's
- **Flexibility**: Timeline is flexible, doesn't have to start immediately
- **Scalability**: Once we get 1-2 projects building, momentum accelerates (bouncing balls visualization)
- **PR Stunt Value**: Leaderboard reveal at TGE creates hype and talkability

---

**Meeting Duration**: ~90 minutes  
**Format**: Open discussion, collaborative planning  
**Goal**: Aligned team, clear action items, energized execution
