# A Lot With Little — Foundation & Family Monetisation Outline

**Context:** Noemi Blager (ALWL founder) is exploring ways to monetise the exhibition’s credibility, global gallery/exhibition access, and architect network. Target: wealthy property developers who share the “a lot with little” ethos and will pay to be formally associated and featured.

**Proposed vehicles:** A Lot With Little Foundation + A Lot With Little Family / Legacy (or Tribe).

---

## 1. Strategic positioning

### 1.1 Foundation vs Family / Legacy

| **A Lot With Little Foundation** | **A Lot With Little Family or Legacy** |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Non-profit / mission vehicle. Grants, research, education, disaster-relief alignment. **Plus:** ALWL Community (online) for sustainability-minded builders and architects — see §1.3. | Membership / partnership vehicle. Developers and visionaries “join” and get featured. |
| Protects ALWL brand integrity; signals “we’re not just selling slots.” | Where the revenue and “slot” offering lives. |
| Can receive donations; can partner with members who want to “give back.” | Where the expensive “slots” and perks are delivered. |

**Recommendation:** Use both. **Foundation** = trust, mission, credibility. **Family** or **Legacy** = the paid membership / featured-developer programme. Landing page: “Join the Family, support the Foundation” or “Become part of the Legacy, support the Foundation.” (See §3.1 for Family vs Legacy.)

### 1.2 Target member profile

- **Wealthy property developers** (or development groups / family offices).
- **Values-aligned:** sustainability, context over concept, social impact, “doing a lot with little.”
- **Motivation:** legacy, PR, access to cultural/architectural circles, association with ALWL and its architects.
- **Willing to pay** for a curated, high-end, limited programme (not a mass membership).

### 1.3 Foundation: ALWL Community and intern

The Foundation should **hire an intern from architectural school** to develop and grow the **A Lot With Little Community** — an **online community** for sustainability-minded builders and architects.

**Purpose of the community:**

- **Discuss what they’re working on** with likeminded individuals (projects, challenges, solutions).
- **Connect with the ALWL team** — direct line to the exhibition, the architects, and the Foundation.
- Extend the ALWL ethos beyond the exhibition tour: a lasting place for the “a lot with little” mindset to live and exchange.

**Intern role (in scope):**

- Develop and moderate the online community (platform TBD: forum, Slack/Discord, member site, etc.).
- Onboard and welcome new members; seed and facilitate conversations.
- Liaise with the ALWL team so the community feels connected to the exhibition and the architects.
- Report on engagement and suggest programming (e.g. Q&As with ALWL architects, themed threads, regional meetups).

**Why an architectural-school intern:** Brings relevant training and passion; affordable for the Foundation; creates a pipeline of talent and future ambassadors; aligns with the Foundation’s education mission.

**Note:** The Community is distinct from the paid Family/Legacy programme — it is open, mission-driven, and sits under the Foundation. Family/Legacy members can be invited into the Community as a perk or as a natural overlap, but the Community itself is broader (builders and architects who share the ethos, not only paying partners).

## 2. The offering: “Slots” and what’s included

Position slots as **limited, by-invitation or by-application** — e.g. “A small number of visionary developers are selected each cycle to join the ALWL Family and be featured on the tour.”

### 2.1 Core perks (deliverables)

| # | Perk | Description (for landing page / proposal) |
|---|-----|------------------------------------------|
| 1 | **ALWL Spotlight Film** | A short documentary capturing the founder’s vision, the project’s history, the heritage of the place, and plans for the future. ALWL-quality storytelling; usable for the developer’s own channels and at exhibitions. |
| 2 | **Featured access at global exhibitions** | The developer’s project (and optionally the film) featured at ALWL partner exhibitions and galleries during the tour. “Stand alongside the work of ALWL architects.” **Use the ALWL exhibition track record prominently** in all Featured Partner materials — see §2.3 below. |
| 3 | **PR package amplifying the tour** | Press releases, media angles, social content, and coordination with ALWL’s tour timeline so the developer’s story is part of the tour narrative. |
| 4 | **ALWL style book on the project** | A printed and/or digital “style book” (or monograph) on the project — ALWL design language, photography, narrative — as a lasting artefact and credential. |
| 5 | **Founder roundtable with ALWL architects** | Exclusive roundtable (in-person or hybrid) with ALWL-featured architects around the exhibition — conversation, not pitch. “Meet the minds behind the exhibition.” A **Family photo** is taken with the architects and Family members, as a lasting record of the partnership. |

### 2.2 Optional add-ons (for pricing tiers or à la carte)

- Private screening of the Spotlight Film at a chosen venue.
- Logo/name in exhibition materials as “ALWL Family” or “In partnership with”.
- One-to-one advisory session with a selected ALWL architect (scoped separately).
- Inclusion in an “ALWL Family” digital gallery or annual publication.

*Note: The roundtable already includes a **Family photo** — architects and Family members together — as part of the core package.*

### 2.3 ALWL exhibition tour — include prominently in Featured Partner offering

**Use this track record in all Featured Partner materials** (landing page, one-pager, proposal, PR): it proves the tour is real, prestigious, and global. Featured Partners join *this* circuit.

| Location | Venue | Dates (past / current) |
|----------|--------|--------------------------|
| **Delft, The Netherlands** | Oostserre, Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, TU Delft | 1–30 Apr 2025 (current) |
| **Dublin, Ireland** | Irish Architecture Foundation | 24 Oct – 1 Dec 2024 |
| **Berlin, Germany** | Deutsches Architektur Zentrum (DAZ) | 8 Mar – 30 June 2024 |
| **London, UK** | Architectural Association (AA) Gallery | 26 Apr – 30 May 2024 |
| **Guangzhou, China** | Guangdong Museum of Art, Guangzhou Design Triennial | 16 Jan – 31 May 2024 |
| **Zurich, Switzerland** | ZAZ Bellerive, Zentrum Architektur Zürich | 26 Jan – 31 Mar 2024 |
| **Prague, Czech Republic** | CAMP (Centre for Architecture and Metropolitan Planning) | 7 Feb – 3 Mar 2024 |
| **Chicago, USA** | MAS Context | 26 Oct 2023 – 27 Jan 2024 |
| **Venice, Italy** | Venice Architecture Biennale 2023 (Carnival mini-film festival, Lesley Lokko) | 26 Sep 2023 |

**Summary line for copy:** “A Lot With Little has been shown at the Venice Biennale, the Architectural Association London, DAZ Berlin, TU Delft, Irish Architecture Foundation, Guangdong Museum of Art, ZAZ Zurich, CAMP Prague, and MAS Context Chicago — and the tour continues. As a Featured Partner, your project joins this circuit.”

**Where to surface it:** Hero or “Why ALWL” on the Family/Legacy landing page; “What you get” alongside perk #2; one-pager and proposal for the possible client; PR package (“your project, on a tour that has appeared at…”).

---

## 3. Membership structure and wording

### 3.1 Naming options

- **ALWL Family** — warm, belonging, community. “Join the Family” is clear and emotional.
- **ALWL Legacy** — lasting impact, enduring story; speaks directly to developers who are building physical and reputational legacies. “Become part of the Legacy” / “Join the Legacy.”
- **ALWL Tribe** — community, shared values, slightly more informal.
- **ALWL Patrons** — traditional arts language; may appeal to certain developers.
- **ALWL Fellows** — implies selection and standing.

#### Family vs Legacy (short take)

| | **Family** | **Legacy** |
|---|------------|------------|
| **Tone** | Warm, inclusive, “you belong.” | Aspirational, enduring, “you’re part of something that lasts.” |
| **Audience fit** | Strong for community-minded developers. | Strong for developers who think in terms of legacy, place-making, and lasting impact. |
| **Risk** | “Family” is widely used in brand language; can feel generic. | “Legacy” can feel weighty; less warm. |
| **Photo** | “Family photo” with architects is a natural fit. | With Legacy, same photo works as “Legacy photo” or “group portrait” — still strong. |

**Recommendation:** **Legacy** is a strong alternative to Family — it aligns well with the target (wealthy developers building places and reputations) and with ALWL’s own “lasting value” message. If the programme should feel more **gravitas and legacy** than **warmth and tribe**, use **“A Lot With Little Legacy.”** If you want maximum warmth and belonging, keep **“A Lot With Little Family.”** Either way, the roundtable photo (architects + members) stays as a core perk; you can call it “Family photo” (works with both) or “Legacy portrait” if you go with Legacy.

### 3.2 How to describe the “slot”

Avoid “buy a slot.” Use language like:

- “**Become a Featured Partner** of A Lot With Little.”
- “**Apply for a limited number of places** in the ALWL Family each year.”
- “**Selected developers** join the tour and are documented in the ALWL tradition.”

Application + selection (even if most qualified applicants are accepted) protects the brand and justifies the price.

### 3.3 Membership “tiers” (optional)

If you want more than one price point:

- **Family Member (Featured)** — full package: film, exhibition feature, PR, style book, roundtable. The main product.
- **Family Friend / Supporter** — lower fee: name in materials, invitation to roundtable and events, no film or style book. For those who want to associate but not yet go “all in.”

Start simple: one clear “Featured Partner” offering; add a lower tier later if demand suggests it.

---

## 4. Landing page: purpose and structure

**Goal:** Explain the Foundation and the Family, who it’s for, what they get, and how to express interest — without yet listing price (price can be “on request” or “following a conversation”).

### 4.1 Suggested sections

1. **Hero**  
   - Headline, e.g. “Join the A Lot With Little Family.”  
   - Subhead: visionary developers, shared ethos, limited places, global exhibition access.  
   - **Optional:** One line naming the tour — e.g. “The exhibition has been shown at the Venice Biennale, the AA London, DAZ Berlin, TU Delft, and more.” (Full list in §2.3.)

2. **Why the Foundation & the Family**  
   - Short paragraph: ALWL’s mission; the Foundation extends it; the Family is how selected developers and projects become part of the story.

3. **Who it’s for**  
   - Property developers and place-makers who care about sustainability, context, and social impact. “If you build with the same ethos we exhibit, we’d like to hear from you.”

4. **What Family membership includes**  
   - Bullet list or cards for the five core perks (film, exhibition feature, PR, style book, roundtable).  
   - **Prominent:** Alongside “Featured access at global exhibitions,” show the ALWL exhibition tour — Venice Biennale, AA London, DAZ Berlin, TU Delft, IAF Dublin, Guangdong Museum of Art, ZAZ Zurich, CAMP Prague, MAS Context Chicago (see §2.3). “Your project joins this circuit.”  
   - Optional: one line on “Supporting the Foundation” (e.g. part of fee or separate donation supports grants/education).

5. **How it works**  
   - Step 1: Expression of interest / short application.  
   - Step 2: Conversation with the ALWL team.  
   - Step 3: Selection and agreement.  
   - Step 4: Onboarding and production (film, style book, PR planning).  
   - Step 5: Featured presence on the tour and at the roundtable.

6. **The ALWL exhibition tour (prominent)**  
   - **Include the full tour list** (see §2.3): Venice Biennale, AA London, DAZ Berlin, TU Delft, IAF Dublin, Guangdong Museum of Art, ZAZ Zurich, CAMP Prague, MAS Context Chicago. Use the table or a simple “Where we’ve been” / “The tour” block. Link to alotwithlittle.com/exhibitions. Reinforces “you join a real, global tour.”

7. **Contact / Apply**  
   - Clear CTA: “Express interest” or “Request a conversation.”  
   - Form or email: name, organisation, project summary, short note on why ALWL/ethos fit.  
   - **After a discovery call:** Send the **Post–Discovery Call questionnaire** (see §8) to refine fit and project details before a formal proposal.  
   - Optional: “A limited number of places are available for [current year/cycle].”

8. **Footer**  
   - Link to main ALWL site; Foundation (if separate); Contact; Privacy.

### 4.2 Tone and design

- Match ALWL: thoughtful, architectural, minimal.  
- Emphasise **selection** and **partnership**, not “buy your way in.”  
- One or two short quotes from Noemi or an ALWL architect about “who we want in the Family” can help.

---

## 5. Pricing

### 5.1 What the price should cover

- Production: Spotlight Film (crew, edit, rights).  
- Style book: design, print, limited run.  
- PR: time and possibly external support.  
- Exhibition coordination: curatorial/partner liaison.  
- Roundtable: venue, logistics, architect participation.  
- Margin and/or contribution to the Foundation.

### 5.2 Pricing approaches

- **Single high price (“Partnership” or “Featured Partner”)**  
  - One number per cycle (e.g. per year or per tour phase).  
  - E.g. £80k–£150k (or equivalent) depending on scope and market.  
  - Conveys exclusivity; simpler to explain.

- **Tiered**  
  - Full package (film + exhibition + PR + style book + roundtable) at premium.  
  - “Supporting” or “Friend” tier at lower price (name, events, no film/book).  
  - Helps capture more prospects and test willingness to pay.

- **À la carte**  
  - Base “Family membership” + add-ons (film, style book, etc.).  
  - More flexible but more complex to sell and deliver.

**Recommendation:** Start with **one clear “Featured Partner” price** (e.g. high five or low six figures in GBP/USD/EUR). Keep it “on request” on the landing page; share the number and scope in the first serious conversation. Use the possible client as a pilot to validate scope, deliverables, and price.

### 5.4 Recommended price and rationale

**Suggested price per Featured Partner slot (one cycle):** **£120,000–£150,000** (or €140,000–€175,000 / $150,000–$185,000 at rough parity).

**Why this range:**

| Factor | Rationale |
|--------|------------|
| **Cost to deliver** | Spotlight Film (crew, edit, rights): ~£25k–50k depending on length and quality. Style book (design, print, limited run): ~£8k–20k. PR (time + possible agency): ~£10k–25k. Roundtable (venue, logistics, architect participation): ~£5k–15k. Exhibition coordination and partner liaison: ~£5k–15k. **Rough delivery cost:** £53k–125k. Price must cover this + margin + Foundation contribution. |
| **Value to the partner** | They receive a lasting film and monograph, association with Venice Biennale / AA / DAZ / TU Delft etc., PR aligned with the tour, and an exclusive roundtable + Family photo with ALWL architects. For a wealthy developer, this is a **legacy and credential** play as much as PR — the film and book are reusable assets; the tour list is a permanent credential. £120k–150k is a serious but plausible commitment for that package. |
| **Positioning** | “High five to low six figures” reinforces exclusivity and selection. Too low (e.g. £40k) undermines “limited, curated” and may not cover delivery. Too high (e.g. £300k) may narrow the funnel before you’ve validated demand. £120k–150k sits in the “serious partner” band without requiring a Fortune 500 budget. |
| **Comparables** | Major exhibition sponsors often pay £50k–500k+ for branding and access; ALWL is offering a **custom** film, book, and featured presence, not just a logo. Arts patron circles are often £10k–50k/year but don’t include bespoke film + book. A Featured Partner slot is closer to “founding partner” or “featured project” — £120k–150k is consistent with that. |

**Practical recommendation:**

- **Lead with a single number** for simplicity: e.g. **£135,000** (or €160,000 / $165,000). Easier to communicate and negotiate from (“we can discuss scope if needed”) than a wide band.
- **Keep it “on request”** on the landing page; share the number after the first call or in the proposal.
- **Use the possible client as a pilot:** If they accept £120k–150k (or the single number), you’ve validated. If they push back, you learn whether to adjust price, scope, or both (e.g. a “Partner Lite” tier without film for a lower fee).
- **Annual or per-cycle:** Define whether the fee is for one “cycle” (e.g. one tour phase, one roundtable, one film + book) or annual membership. If it’s per cycle, clarify what happens in year two (renewal at a lower “alumni” rate, or one-off).

### 5.5 What to test with the first client

- Willingness to pay the proposed price (see §5.4).  
- Which perks they value most (film, roundtable, exhibition, etc.).  
- Timeline (tour dates, roundtable, film delivery).  
- Contract: IP, use of film/book, duration of “Featured Partner” status.
