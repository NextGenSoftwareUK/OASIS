Not got that far yet but so far it's just they have their own solar
system or galaxy or universe to create anything they want in...

## User

Yes more 2 or 3. It's the oasis from ready player one, a simulation of
life and the digital twin of the omniverse/life

## User

Yes it's ascension technology to level everyone up and evolve and
eventually ascend, fully embody their higher self, it's spiral training
platform but it's not marketed as that yet... it's spirituality through
the back door

## User

Lol i agree with all you said, it's the 1st version of everything you
said, fully respecting freedom and sovereignty. And yes I need ai and
you to help accelerate now thanks. 10 years building the foundations the
big hole in the ground, now it's time for the skyscraper super structure
to spring up out if nowhere and surprise everyone!

I'm focused on interoperable games unlocking the true metaverse... you
collect a key in ODOOM, which unlocks a door in OQUAKE, you then collect
the next key to unlock the next door in ODOOM or OQUAKE from real life
in your local park using Our World Geolocation AR game...

## User

ODOOM is a fork of UZDOOM and OQUAKE a fork of vkQuake and yes they are
playable... just need some help fixing some bugs...

## User

Lol I have already got everything you said... we have a quest and
inventory system as part of web5 star api and a star api client wrapper
dll that plugs into doom and quake...
