# OASIS Advisory Call – To-Do List (Jan 27)

From impromptu Google Meet with Hesling Reidinga and advisors. Recording: https://fathom.video/share/y7PXoFxdjsCu8_vxJfT8jUew77RC7Y12

---

## 1. Narrative & story (priority)

- [ ] **Create the core narrative**  
  Linear story: Holon (core) → what Oasis can do → how to access (e.g. Star SDK) → build apps/tools. Philosophy first, then “it already exists, you can build now.”

- [ ] **Draft and lock a manifest**  
  One “positioning and narrative” doc that is the source of truth.

- [ ] **Write a presentation script for Max**  
  Same pitch every time: scripted intro/pitch so the story is coherent and repeatable.

- [ ] **Fine-tune narrative with advisors**  
  Hesling/mapping → mirror back language → lock: “this is the story.”

- [ ] **Clarify Oasis vs Star (and others)**  
  Make clear: Star is part of Oasis (SDK/API to build holonic apps), not a separate project. Align branding so it’s one ecosystem, not “different projects.”

---

## 2. Architecture diagram & mapping

- [ ] **Map everything onto the diagram**  
  Partners, tech, hardware, software, built vs pipeline. Use Hesling’s v1 diagram (gradients optional; can be more schematic).

- [ ] **Place Star correctly**  
  e.g. second/third ring as SDK that “uses” Oasis.

- [ ] **Order the pieces**  
  So anyone can see how Holon → Oasis → Star → apps/tools fit together.

---

## 3. Website & docs

- [ ] **Restructure website around the holon**  
  Start with “core story of the holon,” then Oasis world. Not “protocol first.”

- [ ] **Keep good existing content**  
  Restructure and add; don’t throw away what works.

- [ ] **Put holon at the start of the docs**  
  So people don’t need a separate “what is a holon?” explainer every time.

- [ ] **Go deeper on Holons in documentation**  
  (Max already started a new doc version – continue and center Holons.)

- [ ] **Make docs “super tight” for builders**  
  Clear, dive-in friendly, AI-feedable. Goal: “I want to know more.”

- [ ] **Consider a vibecoding section**  
  How to play with the tech without deep backend knowledge.

---

## 4. Focus & prioritization

- [ ] **Write a single priority list**  
  “Most important thing now” = narrative, branding, platform so people can build.

- [ ] **De-prioritize for now**  
  Karma, avatars, game – treat as “distracting” and “last cycle” until core is solid.

- [ ] **One strong use case**  
  Get one thing (e.g. Holonic Braid) that gets people “totally hyped.”

- [ ] **CEO vs builder balance**  
  Max: core infra, core tech, evangelizing, story; others/community build front-end use cases and products.

---

## 5. Holonic Braid & Hitchhikers

- [ ] **Fix positioning**  
  - Holonic Braid = OpenSERV + Oasis collaboration (the architecture).  
  - Hitchhikers = first partnership *using* that tech (their agentic experience on Oasis infra).  
  - Message: “Hitchhikers uses your tech,” not “Hitchhikers’ tech.”

- [ ] **Arrange LFG (Laissez-Faire) meeting**  
  This week; invite advisors.

- [ ] **Discuss with LFG**  
  Holonic Braid token/monetization, gov partnerships, 50–50 style structure.

- [ ] **Use Holonic Braid for EU pitch**  
  Show efficiency → funding angle (see EU section).

---

## 6. Token

- [ ] **Have explicit conversation with LFG**  
  They’re hesitant on token launch; align on why/when/how.

- [ ] **Decide “which token and how”**  
  OpenSERV involvement implies a token; design which one and mechanics.

- [ ] **Pause heavy Karma/avatar token push**  
  Focus on core tech and one flagship use case first.

- [ ] **Token allocation**  
  Max to propose allocation (including advisors); get something on paper. Advisors to decide what they want and respond.

---

## 7. EU & funding

- [ ] **Share Alina’s name in the group**  
  EU grants, XR Summit rep, tokenomics help.

- [ ] **Hesling to share EU funding contact**  
  Person from his network (European funding).

- [ ] **Position for EU**  
  Efficiency / AI datacenter / energy crisis angle – “super relevant” for EU.

- [ ] **Explore EU Inc.**  
  EU startup structure (Delaware-like); possibly EU entity with advisors “running EU side.”

- [ ] **Plan call with Alina**  
  EU funding and grant strategy.

---

## 8. Community & builders (“army of geeks”)

- [ ] **AMA next week**  
  With Brendan; focus on docs and “how to build” (per existing plan).

- [ ] **Explain holonic architecture in plain language**  
  For builders; support with live demo (“let’s try”).

- [ ] **Talks and demos**  
  Chats, show how it works, get the right people excited.

- [ ] **ClaudeBot / AI agents**  
  When ClaudeBot gets big: have story + integration story ready (e.g. “Oasis inside ClaudeBot”), then do integration video/content.

---

## 9. Content & integrations

- [ ] **Prepare for “ClaudeBot moment”**  
  Story + simple integration so you can ship a “how to integrate Oasis with ClaudeBot” video when relevant.

- [ ] **Build an integration demo backlog**  
  ClaudeBot now; later other tools; aim for a “database of integrations” over time.

- [ ] **Keep “first step” strict**  
  Nail narrative and one use case, then expand use cases.

---

## 10. Admin & follow-up

- [ ] **Set up laissez-faire (LFG) meeting**  
  This week; invite advisors.

- [ ] **Token allocation**  
  Proposal on paper; advisor feedback.

- [ ] **Advisors to think about token allocation**  
  What they want; then align with Max’s proposal.

---

## One-line summary (from call)

**First:** Core narrative and holon-centric story → website and docs → one killer use case (e.g. Holonic Braid) and LFG conversation → EU/funding and token design. **Then** expand use cases, Karma, avatars, and community content.
