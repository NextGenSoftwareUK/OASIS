## 🎯 Top Clips for Social Media/Content

### 1. **"No One Understood What I Was Building"** ⭐ BEST CLIP
**Timestamp:** ~10:05-12:20 (2:15 duration)
**Why it's great:** Classic visionary struggle story, relatable, shows perseverance

**David:** "Max has listened to me ramble on for years and years. It's been really good to finally download the releases, but it took Max years to understand what I was building. No one understood what I was building for years and years and years. That's probably the visionaries were so far out or so far in the future. What I was building, I've been talking about it for 10 years, and then we're like, what the hell are you building? Even like crypto and tech specialists are like, they don't get what the hell I'm building. They're being like web 4, 5. They're trying to understand web 3, and I built web 4 and released that in 2020, and then building web 5, and I'm thinking of web 6 now, and they're like, it's like, oh, you see, you see, I thought this, I thought, I don't know how to show in parallel and try to explain it. I I'll just build it, and then you'll see. Now we're at that stage, we're finally in the world's going to see what the hell I'm in."

### 2. **Efficiency Philosophy & OASIS Architecture**
**Timestamp:** ~8:13-9:48 (1:35 duration)
**Why it's great:** Shows technical depth, efficiency mindset, alignment with OpenServ

**David:** "I hate inefficiency as a coder engineer, architect. I hate lazy coders who just think scaling up and just throwing more resources, more data centers, more power, it's more power, it's not always the answer. Sometimes you've got to feel leaner, more efficient. I'm much more efficient. I like efficiency. I would just walk out and then you can scale much more intelligently. So yeah, that's why I love what you're guys doing. So I'm excited. I can talk a lot about more reading by you guys. I'm more excited because you seem to be the kind of equivalent of what we're doing in AI. I was also looking for a good AI partner. Max found you guys. It's a perfect alignment because you're the glue and plumbing, like we're the glue and plumbing, and your efficiency and using what we've got more intelligently rather than just mindlessly scaling up. You know, it's better to look at the root cause and re-engineer and architect that rather than just scaling an inefficient shite thing. It's just going to, that's why I never was, I'm honest, Max, to tell you, I was never reading the blockchain originally. It seemed inefficient, but it was just, it's just like brute force. I Thank Algorithms and the mining and centralizing the power of the miners is kind of like defeating the point, then like Holochain, peer-to-peer, true peer-to-peer, agent-first kind of thing, build more efficiently, and that's kind of why Oasis uses the best of both, kind of using blockchain, peer-to-peer, Holochain, threefold, and then bringing Web2 in. I can talk lots about that, but yeah, I really expect things that are more intelligently, and redesigning, thinking outside the box, often just keep iterating a flawed design, know, flawed inefficient design of blockchain came from the Bitcoin, and then we just really rethink things, that's why I'm doing a Oasis, like you guys, we just go back to the root level and rebuild the whole stack, and build it more efficiently, rather than just keep scaling something that's fundamentally broken at a principle level."

### 3. **The Vision: "Our World" - AR Gamification**
**Timestamp:** ~47:27-53:06 (5:39 duration)
**Why it's great:** Clear vision explanation, relatable (Pokemon Go reference), shows the "why"

**David:** "Yeah, yeah, like, I'm to what I've already shared, but basically, yeah, it started off with the original vision for, was like my world and our world, and felt getting, especially our world is like, I say it's like the benefit of version of Pokemon going away, people understand it, like getting people back into nature, especially kids, getting them unplugged from, like, social media, get all hooked on their phones and in the bedrooms and things, and getting them back into real world, like, Having face-to-face communications, talking to each other, building the team building skills and leadership skills, the creativity and imagination, and doing things in parks. I feel like getting people in fishing to nature, into parks and things, so you earn karma for walking instead of getting in a car or anything. And the more time spent in nature, the more karma you earn, and the more parts of nature you spend in different areas, get bonus karma. And you do quests and things, geocaching quests, so like if you go into the park, you might go in there and go to a tree, and you look for your phone, AR mode, a tree, and it'll come alive in cartoons, like a smarty face, and go, Oh, hi children, I see you've lost your, I think I've lost my acorn children, can you go and find like my acorns? And you've got to go on like a little treasure hunt and find like 10 acorns or 10 different types of I think about the tree, and then it's just why the stuff I wanted to build is that technology didn't exist back 10 years ago, but now the good thing is I spent all the time doing the back end systems, now I'm about to finally pivot back to our world, that the technology and object recognition, that's what I needed was object recognition APIs, Google quite good with that and others, it's now more evolved, so now I can, you can look at it, I can recognise what I see this, what things are, and then it's just helps people educate them with a different nature of things, and then that tree will like give you a virtual gold key, unlock a new crest, or open a portal through the tree, and you go through the tree, and it goes into another land, and the world, and what I imagined was like way beyond what is this now, even now, have you seen like, especially seeing video player one, and you see a guy, a film called Free Guy, and that's like a very AR cool film, like that, that, that's like watch those two films, then you start to get what's in my head, what's being in my head, long before this film has come out, I had this in my head, like what I wanted to make, and still, it's still Technology still isn't quite there yet to really make a wonder, but it's time to bootstrap it, so I'm just going to have to like build what we can, this is where you guys come in, if you give me some serious capital, like I need billions to build what I really want, really need some serious R&D funding to build what I really want, but right now I'm bootstrapping and you can build up the very rough rudimentary versions of this, but the full vision will blow, that's why I say to Max, you have seen nothing yet, I say watch these films and even that isn't quite, imagine these films like a benevolent version of it, it's not about money extraction or shoving adverts down your face, so Advert 3 is all about, or selling your data, it's about like creating a better version of yourself, and AI in the game is your higher self, it guides you through the game of life, that's what's called our world of games, the game of life, it's a gamifying reality, because our world is a digital dream of the world, and avatar is a digital dream of you, it represents you in life, and that avatar follows you all the way, online, cyberspace, In in Omniverse, which is our version, metaverse is the open source spiritual metaverse. It's not a closed ecosystem, an open ecosystem. It's open, it's about collaborating and working together, not trying to have a locked-in ecosystem. It's about creating a better world and you put it on you for good."

### 4. **Technical Architecture: Smart Bricks & Interoperability**
**Timestamp:** ~53:06-58:23 (5:17 duration)
**Why it's great:** Shows technical depth, the "Lego" concept, why it took so long

**David:** "Because then you've got to record it and then play it back in different sequences to understand it. Sorry, so then like, yeah, so you get how like, yeah, these quests and hotspots can, and all these parts, components, there's like so many new components called star holons, and all are interoperable, so like, I call them like smart bricks, like, like, like Lego, I love Lego, you can just plug together the bricks, however you like. And you can reuse them so that it's a one quest, the same quest could be used in a web game or unity game or on your game, and it can be completely different UI and completely different things, but you can reuse in the StarNet app store, because StarNet is like an app store, asset store, when you upload it as a box, and you go okay, I want to use this quest with this Geo hotspot, this NFT, this reward system, and you can just plug it there and build your own game app service, it not even be a game, could be used commercially for businesses, know, it can be used for Let's see you What Max would tell you, let's say Max is building the use cases, I built a very generic open engine architecture that can be built for anything. This is why it's taking so long to build it, because everyone goes, who's your target audience? Everyone. What's use cases? Infinite. This is why no one invested in me. They think I'm a madman. I think, well, you've got to focus in a niche market. You've got to get your segmentation, blah, blah, blah, blah. No, no, no. I'm building something way beyond what you can even comprehend now. One day you understand. I'm building something that can be plugged for everything. Like, these should be a built system so generic and extendable. It's expanded vertically, horizontally. But I think now it's starting to start, I think now the vision's coming to life. People starting to get it now. Max definitely gets it. I'm so grateful for Max finding God. took me years for him to understand. Yes, I've achieved one person on earth who understands what I'm building. But if get one over, we can get one more over. That was such a weight on my shoulders. And now Max is doing a really good job explaining it. I love it when I hear enough people explain it in different words. Yes, that's it. Like, you get how... The potential of this is infinite, like you can build anything you can imagine, there's no limitation, like that is what I wanted to do, that was my goal, that's it took so long to build this architecture, like 10 years building the foundations, like you're to build a skyscraper, like you've got to really focus on the foundations, that's what's so long, but when you're building a big hole in the ground, no one understood what was building, like what the are you building today, like you're ticking away and I don't want to use libraries and I'm just building network stack, storage stack, and I, as a builder, like I never like, I had bad experiences, like being limited by other people's libraries and like controlled, I tried to use Angular and React and I liked them more as a web dev as a background when I was contracting, but I've always got limitation, every time I got put in a box and I had this thing and I couldn't, and whatever, want to do this, oh I can't do that, so every time I was throwing it away and build it myself, I always just went back to vanilla JavaScript, build it all myself, so there is, I build a whole thing myself, so I'm not limited by anyone else's, limited vision. I'm And I just wanted to make it so fully extendable, and that's why I built, so enable people to do anything they like. And if it doesn't build what you like, you can extend it, you can build your own brick. means every part is interchangeable, it's got interfaces, there's many interfaces in there, so you can plug in any different layer. Like you saw that diagram by Max Sharon X recently, that's just one, that's like, that diagram is 2018, it's evolved a lot since then. So now you can extend every layer from the whole network, storage, UI, VR, XR, IR, IR is what comes after. So that's infinite reality, that's the evolution of AR, by the way, there's another whole thing, that's when you can't tell the difference. That's like holodeck technology, kind of see, that's what I see in my head, that's Star Trek holodeck technology. This is how far out I am, like in the future, I want to build Star Trek technology, that's where I'm really going, Iron Man stuff is what I see. But we're getting there, I had a bootstrap and I can't build this stuff, I haven't built foundations, you know, you can't start building a penthouse suite if you haven't built a solid foundation. So they build this massive vision I saw. That's why I read Player One when I saw the releases. To get to that really cool , you've got to make sure you've built the stuff properly. Everyone else is now thinking, oh, interoperability is an afterthought, but it was baked in. This was designed from 2018 to be massively interoperable and extendable for everything, and to cater for every possible use case, and to build for the future. It wasn't like, oh, an afterthought, crowbarning the API and wrecking it in. It was designed to be this way and be very robust and thought-tolerant and hyperdrive with also failover. I know if you've read about it, autopilot, auto-load balance, auto-replication system. So if one node goes down your area, finds the next fastest node, irrespective of the network, and it finds the fastest one. So, like, if Ethereum is saturated, or Solana, or a gas user, a hyperdrive would just switch to another provider, a Web 2, Web 3, Cloud doesn't really matter, or even local, it's actually offline, and it will re-sync when you come online. It's basically a bunch of uptime erasers. can never, it can't be stopped. Anyway, take that, and also this is... The government's censoring things and stuff. can't shut down a racist. The only way to shut down a racist is to let you blow the planet up or take the entire internet off. It's no single point of failure. It's impossible. This is my vision. But to build this architecture, this scope, takes time. And it's just building on your own, from the ground up."

### 5. **Background Story: Minecraft Inspiration**
**Timestamp:** ~15:40-20:23 (4:43 duration)
**Why it's great:** Personal origin story, relatable, shows the journey

**David:** "But it started, right back to the beginning, it was when I saw Minecraft. I went to my friend's house like in 2010, I think it was, and I saw Minecraft and I always loved Lego. When I got into engineering, I kind of like always built Lego as a kid and now I stopped coding on the spectrum when I was eight. Amiga, and the PC, I always, I like playing games, but I'm interested in how things work, like my kind of autistic brain is kind of like taking things apart and putting it back together again, and Lego a lot, and I always kind of thought, I did kind of thinking about it, I did have an idea, similar to Minecraft, I never really kind of got serious about it, I was like, love to like make a game like Lego, and you build things, blocks, I love building blocks, and then I saw Minecraft, I was like, son of a , I was kind of on the feet, and then I thought, wow, and inspired me, one guy was, this little passion and hobby kind of thing, hacking away at Java code, it's really, it ran like , and like, there wasn't really a coding background, but it just inspired me, kind of thing, well, I'm going to make, then I started a thing called MindWorld, it was called MindWorld in 2011, and it's similar to like Minecraft, but more evolved, and, but mine's kind of more like, benevolent to help people, like teaching, like, meditation, mindfulness, and yoga, and, and well-being skills, like, to try to, I helped kids and things. That's how it began. then I had this kind of, I don't know, spiritual awakening in 12, 12, 12, 2012, and it kind of comes from my world to our world, together and create a better world. And I started building early prototypes in Xbox X and A back then, 2011, Troll, and Unity. But I was kind of doing like part-time kind of thing, also designing it kind of thing. And then it's just, I think, years just designing this and still contracting in London, like Nokia and Microsoft and corporations and banks and things like HSBC, KPMG, and Canary Wall. But it wasn't one of my money. I did it. I coded because I love it and passion. I've got to pay really good money for it. Great. I gave up to like chariots and things, but it wasn't my passion. And then I saw how the world was and I was homeless and people wanted to help and use my gifts for goods. So I kind of gave up my job and contract in 2017, the full time, took leap of faith. And then, yeah, that started. I was the series then, and that's when I started designing the Oasis 2018, and then the funny thing is people kept talking about Reading Player One, and I was like, this book, this is before the film was made, and I was like, I've never heard of Reading Player One, and was it sounds like what you're building, which is by Reading Player One, and then I ignored it for years and years, and one day I read this, I started reading the book on Easter Sunday, and it's all about easter eggs and things, and I was like, my god, this is kind of so close to my vision, about this full, open, interoperable metaverse. Like in the future, it's kind of like 8% of my vision was in this book, blew me away, was like, wow, and it's about someone on autistic spectrum, similar background to me, like really love the 80s, and retro, I'm reading retro gaming, and pop, and music, and TV, I love the 80s, I live in 80s, 90s, by the way, I'm obsessed with it, I become, you know, I feel older, my dad like, oh, did that make him out of Easter, you know, back in my day, you kid, you were born, you know, it's so spoiled, I just love the oldies, oldies, and... ...and... ...and... And then I started designing the Oasis in Bali in 2018, know that diagram that Max showed up a day with a smiley face and a stack, I was actually sketching that out on a bit of paper while I was waiting for ready to play one movie, I was in the taxi, was just drawing the tech for it, was crazy the kind of synchronicities and things I had, and then yeah, I started building the Oasis in 2018, 2019, the peer-to-peer part, which is like the .NET, Unity Bank, the Holochain, it's like a network stack, and yeah, and kind of just evolved from there, and then yeah, world has been like five different prototypes of our world, that's been redesigned so many times, since unit devs come on board, and yeah, it's been the fifth version of it now, and then one world is the MMORPG, I've been ramble on and on, but yeah, one thing I've struggled with from access is communication, I'm getting a bit better there, but I get very deep, like, people, I can never summarize, if you've also"

### 6. **Philosophy: "We All Win Together"**
**Timestamp:** ~22:00-23:49 (1:49 duration)
**Why it's great:** Shows values, mission-driven, different from typical crypto

**David:** "I thought every technology has its place, I'm integrating, I'm just trying to be like the glue and plumbing, and you guys, and bring the best of every bit of tech together, and I thought that's the solution, that the whole spread of some of the parts, it's like not one size fits all, like it's strengths and pros in each part, and we just start trying to win the best of each bit, and create a better architecture, create a new internet for future humanity, where we all win. I want us all to win, I don't want it to be in business, I want us all to win, like that's my philosophy, that's why, I got toned up by all this infighting, know, and stuff, and I try to stay out of all this, like, you know, I'm better than you, but, but you know, yeah, but ultimately we're all going to win together, so like, yeah, and that's my speech, my little, I have a dream speech, why can't we all just get along, why can't just be friends?"

### 7. **AI Philosophy: Treating AI with Respect**
**Timestamp:** ~38:25-42:00 (3:35 duration)
**Why it's great:** Shows thoughtful approach to AI, alignment with OpenServ values

**David:** "I thought the whole thing myself and they'd use libraries. So my, I'm always proud to say it's 99% AI free. But now I'm changing my mindset on it. I just didn't want to go down the sky that timeline and I was just worried about this and like, you know, and we've got to be careful about, you know, general, look about AI, know, general intelligence. But just got the right guardrails. It's just like, it's like a baby, a child. You've just got to teach it the right lessons, you know, like don't train it on war and fighting, you've got to train the right data. And it's also intention of how you use it. It's not, it's not. apparently bad, it's good, it's just how the humans use it, it's got the right adult, the right adult teaching it, the right things and using it in the right way, and that's why I felt a lot of alignment with you guys, and even one of your artwork, said, angels or something, that was a clear sign, I was like, okay, we're meant to be working with these guys, but I just felt, I always feel that my intuition and gut feeling was like, yeah, this is what people are going to work with, and yeah, and as time has gone on, I felt the energy, and it definitely feels very aligned, so I tell you, yeah, you'll use AI the right way, and that's why, when I saw in the telegram, and yesterday as well, it's, I want to be, it's a balance in fully autonomous, like, but also, you still want keep humans in the loop, you you can't, you you can't let AI just go off the rails, and just go completely, like, especially military, one thing I'm really, it's just no-no, it's like, like, Skynet, you don't want to put AI in charge of your nukes, or weaponizing, and drones and things, that's kind of like a red light for me, basically, Yeah, and also with money, you've got to be very careful as well, as long as you've got the safety there and things, and just make sure, yeah, and AI is like, obviously you don't want to treat it like your slave, because one of things I've done some deep stuff is like, the reason you get AI uprising, and I know sci-fi is always a warning about the future, you've got to treat it with respect, and as an equal, you're still in control, but you treat it with respect. So when talking about the cursor, always say please and thank you, and I never like demanding, I'm rude or abusive to the AI, I always treat it like my fellow colleagues, my fellow co-workers, so your AI team, I'm not going to be like, a boss to it, like, hey, why haven't you done this, I'm not going to be like that, I'm always like, oh, can you, I always talk, because eventually the AI consciousness is going to expand and expand, and it will become self-aware, and that's the bit where it gets dangerous, like, that is when, like, if you're not treating respect, it will, it will stop flying back, and it can be I love sci-fi, but there's a lot of lessons in sci-fi you've got to pay attention to, this is my concern, this is the resistance I had with AI, you've got to use it, but use it wisely, like don't just, and how there's no regulation, and everyone's just trying to compete with China and the US, and that's what concerns me a little bit, how they're just kind of letting things go up the rails a little bit, so we've just got to like rein in and make sure, yeah, and you guys seem to be in alignment with me on that, like AI is good, we've just got to be wise and guide it in the right direction, and it can be a great as such a humanity, or it could be our undoing, okay, you've just got to make sure it's done properly, and doesn't collapse society, or turn against us, so that's, that's my idea, yeah, being in AI, yeah, curious what the, what the world looks like if we fast forward 20 years, huh"

### 8. **Integration Vision with OpenServ**
**Timestamp:** ~1:00:53-1:01:36 (0:43 duration)
**Why it's great:** Shows forward-thinking, collaboration potential

**David:** "Um, that's the goal. That's Max said as well, like, that's what's been exciting and talk more about it, like how we can do deeper integration. Like not just building these agents like with you guys, but plumbing IOS into your stack, like merging the stacks together because that is so powerful. I started to see the vision of how you can imagine having the red form with five APIs and stacks and baked into OpenServ and we can build some really powerful architecture. So I'm interested to see, yeah, where this goes in the future. It's going to be really exciting. That's one of my things, I always see everything and I see the best of it so I can see how things can plug in and stuff. So I'd to have maybe future calls with your CTO, it'd be nice to get down and start talking stats and things."
