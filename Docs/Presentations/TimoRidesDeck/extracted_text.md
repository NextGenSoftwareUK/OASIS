## Slide 4

key differentiators

Technical 

Differentiation

Timo combines several emergent 
technologies, giving us a tech stack that 
focuses on interoperability, identity, and 
robustness.

Also notable is our focus on deep 
integrations with local businesses and 
government.

Works offline

Timo doesn’t need a constant 
internet connection to function - 
and can even operate via bluetooth 
connection.

Highly scalable

Timo utilises auto-failover and auto-
load balancing - ensuring the app has 
zero downtime and smooth, reliable 
service

Web2 + web3  
interoperable

Timo uses Abstraction Layer 
technology, giving seamless access 
to both blockchain and database 
systems.

Mobile money / 

stablecoins

Rides are cashless, 

enhancing safety and convenience

and allowing people without bank 
accounts to benefit from the platform

Identity + Trust  
Layer

All riders and drivers are 
credentialled using an interoperable 
identity layer - improving trust and 
safety incrementally.

Local partnerships

+ Government Integration

We bring PathPulse to Africa, 

creating a road intelligence layer that 
transforms every vehicle into a live data 
node with just a smartphone and 
dashcam.

---

## Slide 5

Next-generation integrations

Timo capitalises on emergent systems in AI and Zero Knowledge proofs, to generate additional revenue and added 
layers of protection for users.

Data-as-a-service 
Timo rides generate real time traffic 
data, informing AI models and 
generating new revenue streams

Zero Knowledge KYC
ID Verification is managed securely, 
preventing fake accounts while 
preserving user privacy.

---

## Slide 6

Product: Full choice + customisability

We give users the ability to choose everything about their ride, down to the smallest detail. 

This unlocks trust for tourism operators and corporates who wish to know who they are riding with ahead of time. 

In addition, Timo embeds into partner portals for a seamless experience, with revenue sharing options.
