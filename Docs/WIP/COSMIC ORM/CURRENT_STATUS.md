# COSMIC ORM / CQL current status

Updated 7 November 2026. Goal active and incomplete.

## Current phase

Demo breadth across providers: native queries, MongoDB federation,
live sandbox access and local examples. LINQ depth after entity-selected
stages remains paused. Work on unverified scopes and reproduced bugs.

## Recovery state

- Resumed on the old laptop at C:/Source/OASIS2 on 7 November after the
  recovered laptop failed again. Branch work/cosmic-cql-ton-public.
- Core task branch work/cosmic-cql-decentraland; preserve independent pins.
- Development source82428c7a6/Core2a09c9be code592df8cd isSUCCESS.
  Eight NATS settings staged once; activation8c51a9da isSUCCESS and HTTP accepted.
  DuckDB accepted deployment32b26f74/source evidence remains preserved.
  DuckDB hosted HTTP acceptance passed with the original qualified database,
  unchanged mounted file hash and no WAL before/after the full flow.
- Waku accepted on7672cd5ea/3cdeaf40; PouchDB accepted on2045b41e.
  Both remain included in the current scoped release. Original sources and
  acceptance journals are preserved; the catalogue-cap fix remains covered.
- PouchDB settings/live acceptance job2045b41e succeeded.
- Teaching activation job593cd948-541c-4012-8d0d-654b58ba381d succeeded.
- Scoped release branch work/cosmic-teaching-release-candidate in both repos.
- Website C:/Source/Web4Site, branch work/cosmic-cql, publishedad7e9dd (six new cards71-76; earlier accepted cards retained).
- Dedicated Railway key cosmic-cql-recovery-laptop-20261107 was created on
  this laptop for mounted-source inspection. Its eventual revocation is in
  the old-laptop cleanup ledger. Private key remains outside Git.
- Unknown root logs and Docs/WIP/Cleanup/CLEANUP_LEDGER.md are outside this task.

## Verified

Coverage is **119 scoped local, 91 live HTTP and 28 functional browser**.
The [full provider report](PROVIDER_CQL_AND_SANDBOX_STATUS.md) records each scope.

- MongoDB, SQLite and Neo4j provide the principal owned-storage demo paths.
- IPFS, SOLID and ActivityPub passed hosted multi-row queries and Mongo federation.
- Solana and Google completed browser native3/2, paired5/4, reuse and isolation.
- Latest HTTP additions Oracle Object Storage, Cloudinary and Proof of Humanity
  passed native3/2, Mongo5/4, reuse0new/2existing, privacy and replicas2/2.
  Their cards and local examples are published. Browser gates remain open.
- GUN and OrbitDB first generations are created and separately verified through
  their real SDKs on the existing /data volume. No creation writes were repeated.
  Their hosted CQL passed3/2, Mongo5/4, reuse, privacy and replicas2/2.
  Browser acceptance remains open.
- Graph Studio and PouchDB passed hosted native3/2, Mongo5/4, snapshot reuse,
  independent privacy and exact SQLite/Neo4j replicas2/2. Their website cards
  are published at26e2b4a and exact public HTML is verified. Browser gates open.
- Image CI42339962522 passed for exact9c6e93003 with teaching runtimes enabled.
- Protocol CI42341070588 passed1493 tests/137 skips across six.NET suites
  plus WEB4-WEB10 source publish. Native source acceptance is separate.
- Waku native Store3/2/0, loopback WEB4/Mongo5/4, restart and snapshot passed.

## Exact next step

Qualify Dapr hosting on Linux with a restricted backing store, while advancing
other independent provider scopes whose retained evidence and access are ready. Coverage is119local/
91live HTTP/28functional browser. Source88b896815/Core944d380, settings
8783d8eb-1d65-474f-8bdd-081615d4794a SUCCESS, instance5e85e983.
All13settings and active configuration verified before six first hosted cohorts.
Each passed native3/2, Mongo5/4, first2private saves/repeat0new2existing,
privacy0/public3 and exactSQLite/Neo4j replicas2/2. Original cohorts sealed;
never replay. [Exact batch evidence](SIX_PUBLIC_READERS_HOSTED_BATCH.md).

Websitead7e9dd publishes accepted cards71-76 and retains all earlier cards.
All119 client controls pass; public HTTP200 HTML matches Git exactly.
These are bounded native observations and private snapshots, separate from
wallet execution, full protocol functionality and full provider/ORM parity.

Preserve every accepted source generation, cohort and unknown mutation intent.
Browser URL-policy helper failure remains open without bypass. QuestDB public403,
Chroma/D1 access gates, Nostr operator recovery and David's deferred hosted
databases remain unchanged. Dapr's next hosted proof requires a Linux sidecar
and reviewed restricted backing store; Windows proof does not establish it.

## Source and rollout journals

LocalState/COSMIC/HostedTeachingSourceCurrent/{GUNOASIS,OrbitDBOASIS} holds
immutable source plans, public catalogues, create/verify intents, protected
outcomes and native acknowledgements. GUN verify completed normally.
Orbit's original verify failed on SSH connection before execution. Fresh
inspection proved no verification intent and unchanged source ack. Its one
explicit --resume-unstarted-verify completed; original failure remains retained.
Do not rerun creation or accepted verification. Readers activate only through
the current settings deployment. All13 settings/eight presets observed exactly.
Protected configuration prefix: teaching-public under HostedSourceRolloutCurrent.
Provision-HostedTeachingSource.py has five command tests; native helper has six.

## Remaining gates and constraints

- Finish open browser gates with original cohorts; HTTP/static proof is separate.
- Continue other providers' runtime, restricted-reader and hosting gates.
- Waku hosted HTTP acceptance and public card63 are complete; browser gate remains open.
- PouchDB hosted HTTP acceptance and website publication are complete.
  Retain its native first generation and original acceptance cohort.
  Its hosted browser gate remains open.
- Hosted Azure Cosmos, Oracle DB and PostgreSQL remain deferred by David.
- Never replay accepted cohorts or replace original receipts to regenerate evidence.
- Broader ORM children/depth/history/deltas, migration, placement and HyperDrive
  operator, transport and scale acceptance remain incomplete.
- Disk target107GB remains unmet; preserve personal WSL Miniforge/ML models.
- Subscription20.6MB and finished Graph build outputs1.98GB retained after
  automatic cleanup-policy rejection; exact scopes are in the resource ledger.
