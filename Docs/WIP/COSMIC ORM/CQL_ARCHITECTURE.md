# CQL architecture

Current implementation state: [CURRENT_STATUS](CURRENT_STATUS.md); feature acceptance: [parity checklist](CQL_PARITY_CHECKLIST.md).

1. **Capture:** bounded immutable query/selected-stage intent and closed literals; no user callback execution.
2. **Plan/admit:** explicit scope, eligible targets, exact scalar/relationship capabilities, visibility and work bounds.
3. **Own execution:** V2 HolonManager and physical-attempt owner; preflight all targets and re-admit actual contracts before dispatch.
4. **Native adapters:** Mongo aggregation/snapshot owner, SQLite serializable read owner, Neo4j captured scalar pipeline/read owner. Do not invent stronger provider consistency.
5. **Validate/return:** acknowledged complete detached evidence, exact values and shared remaining work; materialize only where the requested result contract permits it.

For projected All, native counterexample reduction follows every selected stage. Complete source/stage evidence validates before the Boolean is published; final row evidence and the terminal scan consume their budgets.
Source relationship composition has separate admission from entity All predicates. All three native source compilers now support the separate source-composition capability. Complete protected scopes are validated before business truth and paging; source predicates stay native.
Keep source translation, protected errors, membership/visibility and remaining-work accounting in their owning layers. No parallel fallback or silent retry.

[Active acceptance contract](CQL_PROJECTED_ALL_EXECUTION_CONTRACT.md) defines the current invariants.
[Full architecture/history](Archive/CQL_ARCHITECTURE_history_2026-10-27.md) retains earlier detailed designs, subsystem contracts and checkpoint evidence.
[Full ORM history](Archive/COSMIC_ORM_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP_history_2026-10-27.md) retains replication/history/migration/placement and other programme requirements.

The native-only acceptance assembly links the shipping demo and provider adapters;
it does not implement replacement query execution. Its host supplies a V2
HolonManager with an explicit provider registry. The source/composition demo checks
both successful results and protected errors through that manager. Fixture creation,
ownership journals and exact cleanup stay in the test host, outside the read-only
public example. HTTP host contracts remain in their separate integration project.
The partial IQueryable bridge is shared Core code, independent of database type.
It registers owned expression chains with weak keys, binds standard LINQ closure
parameters per execution, captures an immutable CosmicQuery, then re-admits live
capabilities and invokes the existing V2 typed query owner. It neither compiles
application predicates to delegates nor fetches rows for client filtering. The
initial increment flattens exactly one explicitly named physical sequence;
projection/terminal dispatch remains Q01 work, with explicit unsupported errors.
