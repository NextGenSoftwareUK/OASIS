# NextGen Software WEB4 OASIS API Apollo Server.

This module is responsible for starting/shutting down the Apollo Server used for GraphQL queries. NOTE: Apollo integration is a current WIP...

NOTE: This module is not intended to be used standalone, it is simply a dependency for the [OASIS.API.Native.Integrated.EndPoint](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NextGenSoftware.OASIS.API.Native.Integrated.EndPoint) module/package and is the recommended way to use the WEB4 OASIS API along with the REST API below.

Initial Release targeting OASIS API v2.3.1 (Current LIVE REST version):
https://api.oasisweb4.one
