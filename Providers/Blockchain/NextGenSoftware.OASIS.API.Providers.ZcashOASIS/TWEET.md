🚀 Announcing: Zcash OASIS Provider Integration

We've completed full integration of Zcash into the OASIS interoperability framework, meaning you can now store data privately using shielded transactions while maintaining selective auditability through viewing keys. The integration brings Zcash's privacy capabilities to the broader OASIS ecosystem.

Meaning you can now build private DeFi applications, compliance-ready financial systems, and cross-chain privacy solutions. The implementation connects Zcash with other privacy chains like Aztec and Miden, as well as public chains like Solana, through our unified bridge infrastructure.

Built for the Zypherpunk Hackathon, demonstrating how privacy-first blockchains can interoperate seamlessly while preserving their core privacy guarantees.
